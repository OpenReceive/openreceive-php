# OpenReceive agent directions (BTCPay Server)

These directions describe OpenReceive 0.4.14.

Connect a BTCPay Server store to a receive-only NWC wallet with the OpenReceive
plugin, and optionally let payers pay BTCPay invoices with USDT, USDC, ETH or
SOL. You do not need a copy of the OpenReceive source, and there is no
application code to write: the plugin is configured through BTCPay's store UI
or its Greenfield API, and the quickstart is appended to this file in full.

This is the BTCPay plugin, not the Node or Rails library. Do not install
`@openreceive/*` packages or the `openreceive-rails` gem into a BTCPay
deployment, do not add `openreceive_payments` tables, and do not mount
OpenReceive HTTP routes. BTCPay's invoices, checkout, webhooks and Greenfield
API are the host; the plugin only supplies the Lightning backend and the swap
rail.

## What the plugin is

A BTCPay Server plugin (`BTCPayServer.Plugins.OpenReceive`) that registers a
Lightning connection-string handler for `type=openreceive;nwc=<NWC URI>`.
Saving that string makes the NWC wallet the store's Lightning node: BTCPay
mints every Lightning invoice in that wallet and its own `LightningListener`
records the payments. The plugin never calls a NIP-47 `pay_*` method, so
every send-side BTCPay feature (Lightning payouts, pull-payment refunds over
Lightning, the send tab) is unavailable by design.

The one required credential is a receive-only NWC code. A Lightning Swap
Connect (LSC) code optionally adds server-side swaps: a provider order aimed at
the invoice's existing BOLT11, tracked in the plugin's own table, with the
refund path on the same checkout screen.

## Step 0 — check the deployment before you change anything

1. Confirm the BTCPay Server version is 2.4.4 or later (Server Settings →
   About, or `GET /api/v1/server/info`). The plugin declares that minimum and
   BTCPay refuses to load it below.
2. Check whether the plugin is installed (the Plugins menu — the plug icon in
   the top-right corner — under Installed Plugins, or the store navigation
   shows an "OpenReceive" entry). If not, install it from the BTCPay plugin
   directory (the same Plugins menu → Plugin Directory, search "openreceive",
   then Install and Restart now), as the quickstart says; do not invent an
   installer command.
3. Check whether the store already has an OpenReceive connection:
   `GET /api/v1/stores/{storeId}/openreceive/settings` returns
   `lightningNodeIsOpenReceive`. If true, the wallet step is done — go to
   swaps only if the user wants them.
4. If no receive-only NWC code is available, stop and tell the user exactly
   what to create:

   > OpenReceive cannot mint an invoice without a receive-only NWC code. Get
   > one at https://openreceive.org/get_a_nwc_code_to_receive_payments and
   > paste it into Store → OpenReceive → Test connection, or hand it to me and
   > I will set it through the Greenfield API.

   Never print, log or echo the code; report only whether it is set. Never
   paste a bare `nostr+walletconnect://` string into BTCPay's Lightning node
   screen — that form is claimed by the Nostr plugin, without the receive-only
   guard.
5. If the user wants altcoin payments, ask for an LSC code from
   https://openreceive.org/set_up_swap_provider. Do not wait for it: the
   wallet works without it, and swaps switch on later with one settings change.

Only then start the quickstart.

## Non-negotiables

- The connection string is `type=openreceive;nwc=<NWC URI>[;allow-spend=true]`
  and nothing else. Set it through the setup page or
  `PUT /api/v1/stores/{storeId}/openreceive/settings` with `nwcUri`, never by
  editing BTCPay's Lightning node screen by hand.
- Receive-only is required. A code that advertises `pay_invoice` or another
  spend method is refused on save. The override (`allowSpendCapableWallet`,
  the checkbox on the setup page) is the user's explicit choice; never tick it
  to make a save succeed.
- The wallet's network must match BTCPay's. A mismatch is a refusal, not a
  warning.
- The wallet must grant `make_invoice` and `list_transactions`.
  `lookup_invoice` is optional; do not ask the user for a code that grants it.
- Swaps require the store's Lightning node to be the OpenReceive connection.
  Enabling swaps on a store using the internal node is refused
  (`wallet_required`).
- Swaps set the store's invoice expiration to 60 minutes when it is shorter,
  and the plugin refuses to create a swap on an invoice with less than the
  provider's window left. Do not lower the expiration below 45 minutes on a
  swap-enabled store.
- Top-up (amountless) invoices are unsupported on this backend. Do not
  configure a point of sale or payment link that relies on them with this
  wallet.
- Secrets stay server-side. The NWC code and LSC code live in BTCPay's
  database like every other BTCPay credential; never copy them into
  screenshots, tickets, browser code or logs. The provider's order token never
  leaves the server.
- BTCPay's `LightningListener` is the settlement authority. Provider
  `completed` is not payment; only the wallet reporting the Lightning invoice
  settled is. Do not build anything that fulfils on a provider state.
- There is no merchant-initiated refund of a settled Lightning payment. A swap
  refund is a payer reclaiming a deposit that never converted, and only from
  the `refund_required` provider state.

## Verifying

Store → OpenReceive → **Run a health check** (the doctor page) runs every probe now: connection, preflight,
notifications, last scan, provider reachability, invoice expiration, swaps
needing attention. On a regtest machine, `packages/dotnet/docker/up.sh` then
`e2e.sh` in the OpenReceive repository proves the whole path end to end, and
that is the only situation where cloning the repository is the right move.

## The quickstart, in full

Inlined verbatim so this file needs no network access — follow it once Step 0
passes. The page it comes from is https://openreceive.org/guides/quickstart-btcpay.

## BTCPay Server quickstart

Requires BTCPay Server ≥ 2.4.4.

The OpenReceive plugin makes a receive-only NWC wallet the Lightning node of a
BTCPay store. BTCPay creates every Lightning invoice in that wallet. It records
payments the same way it records any other payment. You can also let payers pay
a BTCPay invoice with USDT, USDC, ETH or SOL through a Lightning Swap Connect
provider. The swap pays into the same wallet. The store's internal node is
never used.

This is not the Node or Rails library. There are no hooks, no
`openreceive_payments` table and no OpenReceive HTTP routes. BTCPay's own
invoices, checkout, webhooks and Greenfield API do that work.

### 1. Prerequisites

- A BTCPay Server, version 2.4.4 or later, on any network (mainnet, testnet,
  signet, regtest). The wallet must be on the same network.
- A receive-only NWC code for the wallet you want to receive into
  ([get one here](https://openreceive.org/get_a_nwc_code_to_receive_payments)).
  The code must grant `make_invoice` and `list_transactions` and must not
  advertise any spend method. `lookup_invoice` is optional.
- Optionally, a Lightning Swap Connect (LSC) code from a
  [swap provider](https://openreceive.org/set_up_swap_provider), if payers
  should be able to pay with USDT, USDC, ETH or SOL.

### 2. Install the plugin

Sign in as a **server administrator**. If someone else hosts your server, ask
them to install the plugin for you.

**1. Open the Plugins menu.** It is the plug icon in the top-right corner.

**2. Click Plugin Directory.**

**3. Search for `openreceive`** and click the **OpenReceive** result.

**4. Click Install in BTCPay Server.** Confirm when prompted, then click
**Restart now** and wait for BTCPay to come back.

At startup, BTCPay creates the plugin's two tables in its own Postgres
database: `openreceive_invoices` and `openreceive_swaps`, in the schema
`BTCPayServer.Plugins.OpenReceive`. Nothing else is created.

To build the plugin from source instead, follow
[the .NET workspace README](https://github.com/OpenReceive/openreceive/blob/master/packages/dotnet/README.md).

### 3. Connect the wallet

1. Select your store and open **OpenReceive** in its sidebar, under Wallets.
2. Paste your receive-only NWC code. To see what the wallet supports first,
   click **Test connection**.
3. Click **Save NWC Code**.
4. To turn swaps on, paste a Lightning Swap Connect code and click **Save swap
   settings**.

The page then shows **Wallet connected**. If you set up a provider, it also
shows **Swaps on**. There is nothing else to configure. You never open BTCPay's
Lightning node screen, and the plugin never reads the internal node.

Screenshots for each of those steps, and for creating a first test invoice,
are in the plugin's
[README](https://github.com/OpenReceive/openreceive/blob/master/packages/dotnet/BTCPayServer.Plugins.OpenReceive/README.md).

The plugin refuses to save a code whose wallet advertises a spend method such
as `pay_invoice`. Create a receive-only code instead. If your wallet cannot
make one, there is an override, but using it is a deliberate choice and the
plugin logs it.

Turning swaps on raises the store's invoice expiration to 60 minutes if it is
shorter. A swap needs the invoice to stay open for at least 45 minutes.

### 4. Check it

Click **Run a health check** on the OpenReceive page. It runs every check
right there:

- the connection
- the wallet preflight
- payment notifications
- the last wallet scan
- the swap provider and its assets
- the invoice expiration
- swaps that need a human

Each failing check comes with a link to the fix.

The [BTCPay plugin reference](https://openreceive.org/guides/btcpay-reference.md) lists every setting,
Greenfield route, swap state, log event and check. It also lists what the
plugin does not support by design: every send-side feature, top-up invoices,
and a bare `nostr+walletconnect://` string in BTCPay's Lightning node screen.
