# OpenReceive agent directions (FastAPI)

These directions describe OpenReceive 0.4.14.

Add OpenReceive to a FastAPI application — the app you are already working in.
You do not need a copy of the OpenReceive source: the engine is on PyPI
(`openreceive[fastapi]`), the checkout UI is on npm, and the quickstart is
appended to this file in full, so you can do the whole integration without
fetching anything. Prefer the published packages and the routes the router
serves — do not reimplement wallet RPC, settlement, or pricing.

Do not clone the OpenReceive repository into this app, and do not copy a demo's
models (`ShopOrder`, a signed-cookie visitor, an in-memory catalog) over tables
that already exist. Find this application's order, product, and user models —
whatever they are actually named — and map the three hooks onto those.

Keep this application's frontend framework, authentication and database. Pick
the UI package that matches the frontend that is already here
(`@openreceive/react`, `/vue`, `/svelte`, `/angular`, or `/elements` for
plain HTML or Jinja templates) — do not add React to an HTMX app. Keep
FastAPI's dependency system: the auth dependency this app already resolves
its user with is what `authorize` should call on `context.request`, and the
database OpenReceive gets is a sync SQLAlchemy `Engine` for the SAME
database this app already uses.

## What OpenReceive is

A payment library that runs inside YOUR server. It is an `APIRouter`
(`openreceive_router`, included under `/openreceive`) that serves its HTTP
routes inside the application you are editing, issues Lightning invoices
against a wallet the merchant already controls, and calls back into your code
when one settles. There is no OpenReceive account and no API key, and
OpenReceive never holds the funds — the sats land in the wallet the merchant
connected.

The one required credential is a receive-only NWC code (Nostr Wallet Connect):
a string from the merchant's wallet that can create invoices and read their
status, and cannot spend. A swap provider (an "LSC" code) optionally lets the
payer send USDT, USDC, ETH or SOL instead, converted into that same
Lightning payment. Step 0 collects those credentials from the user; you write three hooks — `authorize`, `amountFor`,
`onPaid`;
OpenReceive supplies invoices, polling, settlement and the checkout UI. It never
owns orders, users, prices, or fulfillment.

## Step 0 — ask for the two codes, one question at a time

Before anything else, look at one file: the project's `.env`, if it exists.
Read it only far enough to see whether `NWC_URI` and `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` are
there and non-empty, and never print the values. A code that is already
set is not asked for again; if both are set, skip to step 5
(making the server load the file), then the quickstart.

Otherwise your next action is a question to the user. Do not install packages,
edit the app, write `.env.example`, or search anywhere else before asking
it. Do not read deploy config (compose files, platform secrets), Docker containers, or process environments, and never run
`printenv`. A new shop has neither code yet: hunting for one burns the turn and
can leak other secrets into the transcript.

Two server-only URIs are needed before the quickstart:

- `NWC_URI` — a receive-only Nostr Wallet Connect code,
  `nostr+walletconnect://…`. Required for Bitcoin.
- `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` — a Lightning Swap Connect URI,
  `lightning+swapconnect://…`. Required for USDT, USDC, ETH and SOL. Skip it
  only when the user says they want Bitcoin alone.

The user never edits an environment file. They paste each code into the chat;
you store it. Ask one question per message.

1. **First message — the NWC code, and nothing else.** Ask for it and walk them
   through getting it:

   > To receive payments I need a receive-only wallet code. In Rizful: open
   > the menu, tap NWC, choose Receive-only NWC code, and tap Copy
   > (https://openreceive.org/get_a_nwc_code_to_receive_payments). If you would
   > rather run your own wallet, Alby Hub works too: Connections → Add
   > Connection → Read Only. Paste the code here and I will store it.

   Do not mention `.env`, exports, or "tell me when it's set".
2. **When they paste it.** If it does not start with `nostr+walletconnect://`,
   ask them to copy the receive-only code again. Otherwise write
   `NWC_URI=<paste>` into the project's `.env`, creating the file if needed.
   Make sure `.gitignore` covers `.env` (and `.dockerignore`, if the app has
   one). Never echo the value, commit it, or put it in client code. Reply only
   that it is saved, then ask the next question.
3. **Second message — swaps.** If the user already asked for stablecoins or
   altcoins, skip the yes/no and go straight to the walkthrough. Otherwise ask
   whether payers should also be able to pay with USDT, USDC, ETH or SOL. The
   walkthrough:

   > Go to https://lightning-swap.com, sign in for API keys, create a key, and
   > copy the whole URI (https://openreceive.org/set_up_swap_provider). Paste
   > it here and I will store it — or say "Bitcoin only" and I will continue
   > without it.

   Mention FixedFloat only if they already use it.
4. **When they paste it.** If it does not start with
   `lightning+swapconnect://`, ask them to copy it again. Otherwise add
   `LSC_URI_PRIMARY=<paste>` to the same `.env`, without echoing it. Swaps
   are now on, so build the refund route back (the swap non-negotiable below) as
   part of this integration. If they chose Bitcoin only, leave
   `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` unset and skip that route.
5. **Make the server load the file — yourself.** OpenReceive reads
   `os.environ`, and a `.env` file on disk is not in it. Start the dev server
   with `uvicorn --env-file .env` (update the app's run script or Procfile, not
   just your own command). When it is started with Docker Compose, give the
   service `env_file: .env`. Restart the server after writing the file.

Do not invent placeholder URIs. Start the quickstart only once `NWC_URI` is
saved and `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` is saved or explicitly declined. The first boot
runs the receive-only preflight: if it reports spend methods such as
`pay_invoice`, remove `NWC_URI` from `.env` and ask for a receive-only code
again. Never set the spend-capable override to get past it.

After the router is wired, run `openreceive doctor --app <module>:app`. It
reports `NWC_URI` presence without printing it, probes the wallet, and names
any hook still on a placeholder and whether the migration ran. Exit code 1 is a
finding to fix, not a reason to skip the check.

### Upgrading an existing install

This is not the opening move of a new integration. When OpenReceive is ALREADY
installed here, the doctor above is the first check. Compare the installed
`openreceive` (`pip show openreceive`) and `@openreceive/browser` against the
release named at the top of this file: the headless display models below do
not exist in older versions, and the first tile click throws with nothing
saying why. Upgrade first.

Only then start the quickstart.

## Non-negotiables

The quickstart below has the code. These are the rules it cannot state for
itself, and they hold for every integration.

- OpenReceive never owns orders, users, prices, or fulfillment. The section
  below is how those tables sit next to the library — not a second order model,
  and not a Prisma/Drizzle relation to `openreceive_payments`.
- Keep `NWC_URI` / `LSC_URI_*` server-only. Never put them in browser code,
  logs, or assets.
- The host owns the price. `amount_for` reads it from your own data; reject
  payer-supplied amounts.
- `authorize` runs on every request, and the `resource` it receives is a CLAIM
  the payer made, not proof. Read the Starlette request's session, cookie or
  auth dependency; never trust a body field.
- `on_paid` must be idempotent. Its database fulfillment commits once per `reference` — your order id, one
  per thing you fulfill, created before checkout, kept across retries, never
  reused. A fresh id per page load lets one order be paid twice.
- Receive-only NWC is required; a spend-capable code fails closed at boot unless
  explicitly overridden.
- There is NO merchant-initiated refund of a settled Lightning payment, because
  the wallet cannot spend. Swap refunds — a payer reclaiming a deposit that
  never converted — are the only refund OpenReceive performs, and only from the
  `refund_required` provider state. Do not build, promise, or imply a Lightning
  refund path.
- IF YOU TURN SWAPS ON, BUILD THE ROUTE BACK. A deposit that arrives short or
  late becomes `refund_required`, and the payer claims it on a SECOND VISIT,
  after leaving your page to fetch an address from another wallet. Three things
  must exist or that money is unreachable through your UI: a per-order URL your
  server serves (`/checkout/:reference` — `syncUrl` on `<Checkout>`, `sync-url`
  or `resumable` on `<openreceive-checkout>`), your own order-summary route to
  restore the order from, and the ATTEMPT.
  `/checkouts/prepare` returns no attempts, so a checkout rebuilt from the
  reference alone opens on the method grid. Re-picking the same coin
  (`POST /swaps`) re-serves the committed attempt — but only while it is live,
  and the shadow invoice behind a swap lasts about half an hour, after which the
  same click mints a NEW deposit address and the refund is off-screen. Keep the
  `payment_hash` and reopen the attempt with `POST /swaps/status`, which has no
  such window. On the drop-ins: `resumePaymentHash`, fed from `onState`, on
  `<Checkout>`; the `resume-payment-hash` attribute, fed from the
  `openreceive-state` event (`event.detail.state.payment_hash`), on
  `<openreceive-checkout>`. https://openreceive.org/guides/swap-refunds.md
- Show the payer WHAT THEY ARE BUYING. Return an optional `description` beside
  the price from `amount_for` and both drop-ins render it above the amount.
  Without it the checkout is a QR and "$1.00" with no sign of what the dollar
  is for.
- Show the payer the transaction record: `createTransactionDetails(...)` rows,
  collapsed behind a caret, on the live checkout AND on the receipt. A payment
  hash and a deposit txid are the only evidence a payer has that they paid you.
  `<Checkout>` / `<openreceive-checkout>` already render this panel and the
  `description` — these two rules cost you code only on a custom UI or your own
  receipt page, never a reason to replace the drop-in. (It returns no rows
  while the rail is `checkout_lock` — before the payer has chosen anything
  there is no transaction — so render the caret only when the rows are
  non-empty.)
- Include the router under the prefix — `app.include_router(
  openreceive_router(host, engine=engine), prefix="/openreceive")` — and give
  the app `lifespan=openreceive_lifespan(host, engine=engine)` so a bad wallet
  stops the deploy. Do not add a CSRF layer for these routes: FastAPI has
  none and the engine's `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site` refusal is the
  protection. Behind a reverse proxy run uvicorn with `--proxy-headers`, or
  `rate_limiting` counts the proxy as the one payer.
- The engine is synchronous by design: the router's endpoint runs in
  Starlette's threadpool. Do not wrap it in `async def` code of your own, and
  do not hand OpenReceive an async database session — it wants a sync
  SQLAlchemy `Engine`.
- HTTP JSON is snake_case, and so is the Python API (`payment_hash`,
  `amount_msats`).
- Money is integers or decimal strings — never binary floats.

## Your tables, not ours

`openreceive scaffold payments --alembic` (or `--sql`) emits
`openreceive_payments` and `openreceive_meta` for THIS application's database.
That is the whole persistence OpenReceive needs. It does not replace your
orders, users, or products, and you do not join them.

- **Find this app's models first.** They may be named `Order`, `Invoice`,
  `Booking`, `Product`, `Variant`, `User`, `Account` — anything. Wire the hooks
  to those. Do not generate a parallel `ShopOrder` / `ShopProduct` / `ShopUser`
  stack.
- **The payable row's id is the `reference`.** Create it before checkout, keep
  it across retries, never reuse it. Pass that id to `<Checkout>` /
  `<openreceive-checkout>`. A fresh id per page load lets one order be paid
  twice.
- **Products (or the catalog) are the price authority.** Order creation reads
  live prices into the order (snapshot line items if this app has them).
  `amount_for` reads only that order — never a payer-supplied amount, never a
  live catalog lookup that could re-price a cart already placed. Return
  `{"currency", "value"}` as a decimal STRING, plus a `description` of what
  they are buying.
- **Users own the order; OpenReceive never sees them.** `authorize` uses the
  same ownership check this app already uses on the order show / pay page —
  the `current_user` dependency, a session cookie, whatever it is, resolved
  from `context.request`. `context.resource["reference"]` is a claim the
  payer sent, not proof.
- **The order is unpaid or paid.** Do not copy `pending` / `expired` / `failed`
  / `attention` onto it. Those are attempt statuses on `openreceive_payments`. An
  expired invoice does not cancel the order; a later checkout may mint another
  attempt. The library refuses a new checkout under a reference that already
  settled (409).
- **Pass a sync SQLAlchemy `Engine` for this app's database.** Do not add an
  ORM relationship from Order to `openreceive_payments`, and do not implement
  `PaymentRepository` unless no SQLAlchemy engine can reach this database.
  `reference` is not unique (many attempts per order). Fulfillment is a
  guarded transition on YOUR order row inside `on_paid` — `UPDATE … WHERE
  state = 'awaiting_payment'` (or this app's equivalent) through
  `settlement.connection`, the settlement transaction's own connection, not a
  second session from your ORM. Database writes only in the hook; emails,
  jobs, and pushes in `after_paid` or after commit.

## If you build your own checkout UI

The drop-ins (`<Checkout>`, `<openreceive-checkout>`) already obey all of this.
This list is the short form of https://openreceive.org/guides/checkout-ux.md, for a
UI built on `@openreceive/browser/headless`. Read that before writing
components.

- Check Bitcoin → Switch payment method → Bitcoin: the grid must hide the
  Lightning invoice, then restore the same bolt11 without another mint.
- `createCheckoutController` is the engine. Do not hand-roll a poll loop.
- `createCheckoutStatusModel` for the status line. Do not draw a
  Cart → Pay → Done stepper. Read the model's `phase`, not the snapshot's.
- `resolveWizardSelection` decides whether to ask "which network?". A
  one-network asset starts the swap from the tile. Key `selectedAssetByGroup`
  by group (`USDT`), valued by `pay_in_asset` (`USDT_TRON`).
- `createMethodGridDisplay` for tiles, including `limitMessage` so an
  unavailable method says the minimum in the payer's currency.
- `createSwapDisplayModel` → `display.copyRows` for deposits: address, memo,
  and the bare amount each get a copy row. Render `swap.networkWarning*` as
  the model gives it.
- `swap.deposit_amount` is the only amount a payer is told to send. Never put
  a fiat valuation of it (`swap.fee.pay_in_fiat`) next to a stablecoin amount:
  "$50.03" under "50.05 USDC" reads as a typo, and the payer asks which one to
  send. The one fiat figure on a USDT/USDC deposit panel is the cart total
  (`payout_fiat`); express "you send" and the fee in the token. Use
  `createSwapFeeBreakdown(fee, swap)` — with the swap, not the fee alone — and
  it applies this for you; SOL and ETH keep a fiat breakdown.
- `createCheckoutSession` owns mint and swap start. To start swaps, pass its
  `swap` option (`selection`, `prefix`, `fetch`) together. Without it
  `startSwap` reports through `onError`.
- `createQrSvg` is async. Use `createQrSvgController` so you do not render
  `[object Promise]`.
- `checkoutLabels` for every payer-facing string. Only write copy it lacks.
- `stageSwapRefund` then `confirmSwapRefund` — only the second submits.
  Validate with `getSwapRefundFormError`. Treat `409` as a normal outcome.
- Pass `{ resumable: true }` to `createSwapDisplayModel` when the payer has
  a URL they can come back to, and render `display.refundReturnLabel`.
  Resume helpers (`createGuestCheckoutResume`, `createGuestOrderFetcher`)
  are on `@openreceive/browser`, not `/headless`.
- A refund replaces the deposit panel. On `refund_required` also drop
  "switch payment method".
- No "Open wallet" button on desktop.
- Wallet suggestions: `getPaymentWizardRoutes()` +
  `createWizardRouteDisplays`. Lightning only. Logos are data URIs; tutorial
  images load from a JavaScript chunk. For a custom headless UI, load it when
  a tutorial opens and look up the returned table by the tutorial's `path`:

  ```js
  import { loadPayTutorialImages } from "@openreceive/browser/headless";

  const images = await loadPayTutorialImages();
  const src = images[tutorial.path]; // data URI for the selected tutorial
  ```

  Render `src` as the image source and update your UI after loading. Existing
  display objects do not update: their `tutorial.image` stays `undefined` if
  created before loading. Alternatively, await the loader, recreate the displays
  with `createWizardRouteDisplays`, and render the new `tutorial.image`.
  Show the caption while loading or if loading fails; never use an empty image
  source. Deploy all JavaScript chunks and allow `data:` in CSP `img-src`.
  For missing images, check CSP errors, failed chunks, and stale displays.
  Registry paths are lookup keys; there is no asset option or image route.

## The quickstart, in full

Inlined verbatim so this file needs no network access — follow it once Step 0
passes. The page it comes from is https://openreceive.org/guides/quickstart-fastapi.

## FastAPI quickstart

FastAPI + React. Requires Python ≥ 3.10, FastAPI ≥ 0.115 (Starlette ≥ 0.40)
and a SQLAlchemy 2 `Engine` for OpenReceive's two tables.

### 1. Install

```sh
pip install "openreceive[fastapi]"
npm install @openreceive/react
```

OpenReceive is one Python distribution with framework extras.
`openreceive[fastapi]` brings FastAPI, Starlette and SQLAlchemy. The base
package includes the wallet client (websockets, coincurve, cryptography), the
HTTP engine and the `openreceive` CLI. The npm package is the checkout UI for
your frontend. On a different stack, swap the two: use `openreceive[django]`
with the Django quickstart. A page without a bundler uses
`@openreceive/elements` instead of React.

|          | Packages                                                                                                                      |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server   | `openreceive[fastapi]`, `openreceive[django]`, `openreceive[sqlalchemy]` (Flask and plain WSGI/ASGI: the Flask recipe) |
| Frontend | `@openreceive/react`, `@openreceive/vue`, `@openreceive/svelte`, `@openreceive/angular`, `@openreceive/elements` (plain HTML) |

Use `uv` or a virtualenv on Python 3.10 or newer. A system Python 3.9 cannot
install the package.

### 2. Migrate the payment tables

```sh
openreceive scaffold payments --alembic --dialect postgres    # or sqlite | mysql
```

`openreceive scaffold payments --alembic` writes one Alembic revision into
`alembic/versions/`. The DDL is frozen in the file, and it creates two tables:

- `openreceive_payments`, the payment attempts
- `openreceive_meta`, the reconcile gate

Set the revision's `down_revision` to your current head (`alembic heads`).
Then apply it the way you apply your own revisions: `alembic upgrade head`.
The command never opens a database connection.
→ [openreceive scaffold payments](https://openreceive.org/guides/api-reference.md#openreceive-scaffold-payments-python)

No Alembic? `openreceive scaffold payments --sql --dialect postgres` prints
the same DDL. Feed it to `psql`, a Flyway file, or whatever runs your
migrations. In code, `payments_schema_sql(dialect)` from
`openreceive.storage.sql` returns the same string. OpenReceive owns the
tables' logic at runtime: locking, write-once settlement, and the
reconciliation state machine. There is nothing else to generate. Details: [Payment storage](https://openreceive.org/guides/storage.md).

### 3. Add wallet credentials

Put the credentials in the server's environment. That can be a `.env` your
process manager loads, `uvicorn --env-file .env`, or your secret store:

```dotenv
NWC_URI=
LSC_URI_PRIMARY=
LSC_URI_BACKUP=
```

1. Get a receive-only NWC code from a compatible wallet
   ([get one here](https://openreceive.org/get_a_nwc_code_to_receive_payments)).
   Put it in `NWC_URI`.
2. Optional: set up a [swap provider](https://openreceive.org/set_up_swap_provider).
   Put its connection string in `LSC_URI_PRIMARY`, and a second one in
   `LSC_URI_BACKUP` if you have one.

Never put these values in browser code. Your app refuses to start if the NWC
code also advertises spend methods such as `pay_invoice`. Create a
receive-only code instead ([Security](https://openreceive.org/guides/security.md)).

OpenReceive reads `os.environ`, so a `.env` file on disk is not enough on its
own. `uvicorn --env-file .env` loads one in development. In production, the
process manager or secret store injects the values.
[Environment variables](https://openreceive.org/guides/environment-variables.md) lists every variable.

### 4. Wire OpenReceive

The wiring takes twelve lines:

- your three hooks as a `Host`
- a router included under a prefix
- a lifespan that checks the wallet at startup

The router builds the wallet client from `NWC_URI` and mounts the
framework-free engine. There is no background reconciler, meaning no job that checks pending
payments on a timer. Settlement runs during normal requests instead, through
the durable reconcile gate.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from openreceive.fastapi import openreceive_lifespan, openreceive_router
from openreceive.server import Host
from .app import current_user, orders  # your existing models and auth dependency

# OpenReceive's own sync Engine for its two tables — the SAME database as
# your orders, its own connection pool. On SQLite give it a dedicated Engine.
engine = create_engine("postgresql+psycopg://…")

host = Host(
    # The price for a reference — here, your order id — from your own data;
    # OpenReceive converts it into the Lightning invoice. Return None when
    # there is nothing to pay for. `value` is a decimal STRING from the order
    # row, never a float and never a request param. `description` is what the
    # payer is buying, in your own words.
    amount_for=lambda reference: (
        {"currency": "USD", "value": str(order.total), "description": order.summary}
        if (order := orders.find(reference))
        else None
    ),
    # Your own access check: may this caller do this action to this reference?
    # `context.request` is the untouched Starlette Request — reuse the same
    # dependency your order page uses. `context.resource["reference"]` is a
    # claim the payer's browser sent, not proof.
    authorize=lambda context: orders.viewer_may(
        current_user(context.request), context.resource["reference"], context.action
    ),
    # INSIDE the settlement transaction; runs only for the reference's first
    # settled attempt. Use `settlement.connection` (that transaction) for the
    # order write, never a second session. The WHERE clause is the lock.
    on_paid=lambda settlement: settlement.connection.execute(
        orders.claim_paid(settlement.reference, settlement.paid_at)
    ),
)

app = FastAPI(lifespan=openreceive_lifespan(host, engine=engine))
app.include_router(
    # Recommended for public web shops: `rate_limiting=True` caps invoice
    # creation at 60 per client IP per hour. Leave it off (the default) for
    # point-of-sale deployments, where many payers share the terminal's IP.
    openreceive_router(host, engine=engine, rate_limiting=True),
    prefix="/openreceive",
)
```

`authorize` receives the Starlette `Request`. Cookies, headers, and whatever
`SessionMiddleware` or auth dependency this app already has are readable
there. FastAPI ships no session of its own, so you must bind the payer's
`reference` to something the request proves. Behind a reverse proxy, run
uvicorn with `--proxy-headers`. Otherwise `rate_limiting` counts the proxy as
the one payer.

**There is no CSRF layer to add.** FastAPI has no CSRF (cross-site request
forgery) layer, and OpenReceive does not want one. Every mounted route refuses
a request whose `Sec-Fetch-Site` header says `cross-site`. That stops another
origin's page from minting or refunding on a logged-in payer's behalf. The
Express and Fastify adapters rely on exactly the same protection. Its limit is
the header itself. A client that does not send it, such as a non-browser or an
old browser, is not refused. So `authorize` stays the actual boundary.
[Security](https://openreceive.org/guides/security.md) has the full account.

`openreceive_lifespan` runs the receive-only wallet preflight when uvicorn
starts. It stops the process if the code is missing, unreachable, or able to
spend. That way the deploy fails instead of the first payer. Pass `lazy=True`
for tests and for build steps that have no secrets. The first request then
checks the wallet, and requests get `503 WALLET_UNAVAILABLE` until the check
passes.
→ [openreceive_router](https://openreceive.org/guides/api-reference.md#openreceive_router) ·
[openreceive_lifespan](https://openreceive.org/guides/api-reference.md#openreceive_lifespan) ·
[the authorize context](https://openreceive.org/guides/api-reference.md#the-authorize-context)

`rate_limiting=True` is for public web shops. Leave it off for point-of-sale,
where many payers share one IP. → [Rate limiting](https://openreceive.org/guides/rate-limiting.md)

An optional worker, `openreceive notifications --app main:app`, listens for
wallet payment notifications so settlement does not wait for the next page
load. → [openreceive notifications](https://openreceive.org/guides/api-reference.md#openreceive-notifications)

Your app also needs an ordinary order-creation route that validates the cart,
prices with exact decimal math, and returns the order id the page will pass as
the `reference`. OpenReceive never prices from payer input.

The `reference` is a string you choose, and it is the fulfillment identity:
your order id. Use one per thing you fulfill, create it before checkout, keep
it across retries, and never reuse it. OpenReceive never looks inside it, but
the reference still matters:

- `on_paid` commits fulfillment once per reference.
- A new checkout under a reference that already settled is refused with 409.
- A fresh id per page load lets one order be paid twice.

Naming boundary: the Python API is snake_case (`payment_hash`,
`amount_msats`), and so is everything on the wire. The mounted HTTP routes and
the browser snapshots use the same names.

### 5. Render checkout

```tsx
import { Checkout } from "@openreceive/react";
import "@openreceive/react/styles.css";

<Checkout reference={order.id} prefix="/openreceive" />;
```

The checkout renders, polls, and settles itself.

`@openreceive/react` and `@openreceive/elements` each ship a compiled
`styles.css`. Each sheet is self-contained, so a plain
`<link rel="stylesheet">` works with no build step. Each is also scoped: every
rule applies only inside what OpenReceive renders.

Serve the compiled `styles.css` without Tailwind processing. Import it from
JavaScript if your bundler handles CSS, or use a plain
`<link rel="stylesheet">`. Do not `@import` it into your app's Tailwind entry.
Its rules have zero specificity, so your page's styles can override checkout
styles. Scoping does not prevent that.

`<Checkout>` is complete as rendered. It already shows the `description` from
`amountFor` and the collapsed transaction-details panel. Do not build a custom
UI to show them. The display rules for them become your job only if you
replace the drop-in component ([Checkout UX](https://openreceive.org/guides/checkout-ux.md)).

Match the host page's theme. By default the checkout follows the payer's
stored choice, then the system color scheme. If this page always uses one
theme, lock it with `<Checkout theme="dark" … />`. On the custom element, set
the `theme` attribute. Locking the theme keeps a white card off a dark page.
CSS variables under `data-theme` style the checkout.
[Frontend checkout](https://openreceive.org/guides/frontend-checkout.md) lists the settings you can change.

Everything the checkout draws ships inside the JavaScript: the payment-method
icons, the wallet logos, and the pay tutorials. There is no image file to copy
or serve, and no asset option to set. Deploy your normal JavaScript and CSS
build output, including any generated JavaScript chunks. Bundlers with code
splitting can wait to load tutorial screenshots until a tutorial first opens.
Single-file builds, including the standalone checkout, include them from the
start. If your Content-Security-Policy has a strict `img-src`, allow `data:`
([Provider registry](https://openreceive.org/guides/provider-registry.md#assets)).

That is the whole loop. Your server owns the price and the order. The payer
gets an invoice. `onPaid` runs inside the settlement transaction. If that
transaction rolls back, the callback may run again. For delivery to outside
systems, use an outbox in your app: record the message in the transaction and
send it after commit.

A page without a bundler renders the same checkout as a custom element:
`<openreceive-checkout reference="…" prefix="/openreceive">` from
`@openreceive/elements`. You can also serve its standalone build from your
static directory.

Buy a Button is a runnable illustration of the boundary
(`examples/buttons/server/fastapi`).
It is not a template to copy models from. It keeps products, visitors and
orders in SQLite, and the three hooks are the only bridge to OpenReceive. It
is the smallest correct FastAPI integration of the packaged checkout. Map that
shape onto the models in THIS app.

### 6. Verify

```sh
openreceive doctor --app main:app
```

`openreceive doctor` checks Python, `NWC_URI`, and swap-provider
configuration. It also probes the wallet relay to confirm the code is
receive-only. With `--app module:attr` (your FastAPI app, the router, or an
`OpenReceiveApp`), it also confirms the migration ran and names any hook still
on a placeholder. Add `--url http://localhost:8000` to confirm the routes are
mounted. Every failing line states its own fix, and the command exits with
code 1 when anything fails. `openreceive debug-report` prints the same output
as a redacted support report.
→ [openreceive doctor](https://openreceive.org/guides/api-reference.md#openreceive-doctor-python)

Then open the checkout in a browser, confirm the payment-method icons and
wallet logos render, and open a wallet's pay tutorial to check its screenshots.
If an image is missing, inspect the console for CSP violations and the Network
panel for failed JavaScript chunks. Allow `data:` in `img-src` and deploy the
complete build output. Do not add image routes, copy package source images, or
use registry `icon_path` / tutorial `path` keys as browser URLs.

Swap credentials (`LSC_URI_*`) stay server-side too. The provider order id and
token live in the attempt's server-only `swap_data` column. They never reach a
response or a log ([Automated swaps](https://openreceive.org/guides/automated-swaps.md)).
