```

**Step 0 in brief** (Step 0 below has the details):

- Before adding packages or editing anything, ask the user for a receive-only NWC code. One question per message.
- Next ask for the LSC code. If the user wants stablecoins, USDT, USDC, ETH, SOL or crypto, do not ask yes/no first.
- Ask for NWC_URI and LSC_URI_PRIMARY with Lovable's secret input. Never put a code in .env, code or a VITE_ name.
- You have no terminal: never ask the user to run a command. Every step is a file, a package, a migration or a secret.
- Do not suggest rotating or revoking a code because it was pasted here.
- Start Step 1 only once NWC_URI is saved, and LSC_URI_PRIMARY is saved or the user said "Bitcoin only".

These directions describe OpenReceive 0.4.22.

Add OpenReceive to this Lovable app: a TanStack Start app on Cloudflare
Workers, with Lovable Cloud or a connected Supabase project as its database.
These directions are written for Lovable's agent. You have no terminal, so
every step is a file edit, a package, a Supabase migration or a secret. Never
ask the user to run a command. The TanStack Start recipe is appended to this
file in full; its "On Supabase (Lovable)" section is the code to follow.

Do not clone the OpenReceive repository, and do not copy a demo's models over
tables that already exist. Find this app's orders and products, whatever they
are named, and map the hooks onto those. Keep this app's UI, sign-in and
database.

## What OpenReceive is

A payment library that runs inside THIS app's server code. It mounts as one
TanStack Start server route (`src/routes/openreceive.$.ts`), issues Lightning
invoices against a wallet the merchant already controls, and settles each
payment into this app's Supabase database. There is no OpenReceive account
and no API key, and OpenReceive never holds the funds: the sats land in the
merchant's wallet.

The one required credential is a receive-only NWC code (Nostr Wallet
Connect): a string from the merchant's wallet that can create invoices and
read their status, and cannot spend. A swap provider (an "LSC" code)
optionally lets the payer send USDT, USDC, ETH or SOL instead, converted into
that same Lightning payment. Step 0 collects those credentials. You write two
hooks in TypeScript, `amountFor` and `authorize`, and one SQL function,
`openreceive_on_paid`, that marks the order paid. OpenReceive supplies
invoices, polling, settlement and the checkout UI. It never owns orders,
users, prices, or fulfillment.

On Lovable, OpenReceive keeps its payment rows in this app's Supabase
database and reaches it over Supabase's HTTPS API with the project's secret
key, because a Worker cannot open a Postgres connection to Supabase.

## Step 0 — ask for the two codes, one secret at a time

If the user says the codes are already saved as this project's secrets
(`NWC_URI`, and `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` unless they want Bitcoin only), believe
them: do not ask for them, and go to Step 1. You cannot read a secret's value,
and you do not need to.

Otherwise, before anything else, your next action is a question to the user.
Do not add packages, write migrations or edit files before asking it. A new
shop has neither code yet.

Two server-only secrets are needed before the integration:

- `NWC_URI` — a receive-only Nostr Wallet Connect code,
  `nostr+walletconnect://…`. Required for Bitcoin.
- `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` — a Lightning Swap Connect URI,
  `lightning+swapconnect://…`. Required for USDT, USDC, ETH and SOL. Skip it
  only when the user says they want Bitcoin alone.

Ask for each one with Lovable's secure secret input, named exactly as above.
The user never edits a file: they paste each code into this chat or into
that secret input, and Lovable stores it as a project secret. A code pasted
into the chat is saved as a secret too. Never repeat a code back. Ask one
question per message.

1. **First message — the NWC code, and nothing else.** Ask for the secret
   `NWC_URI` and walk them through getting it:

   > To receive payments I need a receive-only wallet code. In Rizful: open
   > the menu, tap NWC, choose Receive-only NWC code, and tap Copy
   > (https://openreceive.org/get_a_nwc_code_to_receive_payments). If you would
   > rather run your own wallet, Alby Hub works too: Connections → Add
   > Connection → Read Only. Paste it into the secret input for NWC_URI.

2. **When it is saved.** If the user pasted it into the chat and it does not
   start with `nostr+walletconnect://`, ask them to copy the receive-only code
   again. Reply only that it is saved, then ask the next question.
3. **Second message — swaps.** If the user asked for stablecoins, USDT, USDC,
   ETH, SOL, altcoins or "crypto" (as in "Bitcoin and stablecoin payments"),
   this message IS the walkthrough below: send it as it is, and do not ask yes
   or no first. Otherwise ask whether payers should also be able to pay with
   USDT, USDC, ETH or SOL, then give the walkthrough. The walkthrough:

   > Go to https://lightning-swap.com, sign in for API keys, create a key, and
   > copy the whole URI (https://openreceive.org/set_up_swap_provider). Paste
   > it into the secret input for LSC_URI_PRIMARY — or say "Bitcoin only" and
   > I will continue without it.

   Mention FixedFloat only if they already use it. Swaps on means the refund
   route back is part of this integration (the swap non-negotiable below).
4. **Supabase.** Lovable sets `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   for server code when Lovable Cloud, or a connected Supabase project, is on.
   Do not ask for them or try to create them: Lovable reserves the
   `SUPABASE_` prefix. If this project has no backend yet, ask the user to
   turn on Lovable Cloud, and wait until they have.

Never give a code a `VITE_` prefix, never put one in `.env` (Lovable commits
that file), and never write one into code or a log. Do not invent placeholder
codes. Start Step 1 only once `NWC_URI` is saved and `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` is
saved or explicitly declined.

## Step 1 — the packages

Add `@openreceive/http` and `@openreceive/react` at 0.4.22 or newer.
Nothing else: no `pg`, no Postgres driver, no OpenReceive scaffold. Do not
change the Vite or Wrangler configuration.

## Step 2 — the migration

Fetch https://openreceive.org/guides/supabase-migration.md and copy its SQL
block, unchanged, into one new Supabase migration, then apply it. Do not edit
it, split it, rename anything in it, or drop its `revoke` lines. It creates
`openreceive_payments` and `openreceive_meta` with row level security on and
every grant revoked from `anon` and `authenticated`, the functions the server
calls to write them, and `openreceive_on_paid` as a placeholder that refuses
every settlement.

## Step 3 — the order and its buyer

- **The order's id is the `reference`.** Create the order before checkout,
  keep it across retries, never reuse it. A fresh id per page load lets one
  order be paid twice.
- **The order row is the price.** Order creation copies live prices into the
  order. `amountFor` reads only that order and returns
  `{ currency, value, description }`, the value a decimal string such as
  `"12.50"`, and `null` for an order that is not payable.
- **The buyer is a cookie.** The checkout calls the payment routes from the
  browser with the page's cookies and nothing else, and a Lovable app keeps
  its Supabase sign-in in the browser, not in a cookie. So in a migration add
  `buyer_token text` to the orders table, and create orders in a server
  function (`createServerFn`) that reads the `buyer` cookie, or sets one to
  `crypto.randomUUID()` (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax, path `/`, one
  year) with `getCookie` and `setCookie` from `@tanstack/react-start/server`,
  then inserts the order with `buyer_token` set to it through `supabaseAdmin`
  from `@/integrations/supabase/client.server`, and returns the id. If the app
  creates orders in the browser today, move that insert into this function.
  Keep the order's user column too, if the app has sign-in.
- **The order is unpaid or paid.** Do not copy attempt statuses (`pending`,
  `expired`, `failed`, `attention`) onto it, and do not add a relation to
  `openreceive_payments`.

## Step 4 — `openreceive_on_paid`

In a second new migration, replace the placeholder with the SQL that marks
this app's order paid. Use `create or replace`, and this app's own table,
column and status names:

```sql
create or replace function public.openreceive_on_paid(
  p_reference text, p_payment_hash text, p_paid_at bigint
) returns void language plpgsql as $$
begin
  update public.orders
     set status = 'paid'
   where id = p_reference::uuid   -- or just p_reference, if the ids are text
     and status = 'pending';
end
$$;
```

It runs inside the transaction that records the payment, for the order's
first settled payment only. If it raises, nothing is recorded, and the next
request retries it. Its `WHERE` on the unpaid status is the guard against a
second fulfillment. Keep it to database writes.

## Step 5 — the payment route

Write `src/routes/openreceive.$.ts` and `src/lib/openreceive.server.ts`
exactly as the recipe's "On Supabase (Lovable)" section shows:

- `storage: { supabase: { url: process.env.SUPABASE_URL, key: process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY } }`,
  read inside the handler, never at module scope.
- No `onPaid` and no `db`: `openreceive_on_paid` is the fulfillment.
- `findOrder` reads the order with `supabaseAdmin`; `authorize` compares the
  request's `buyer` cookie with the order's `buyer_token`.
- Build the stack inside each request and close it in `finally`.
- Import the server module only inside the route's handlers, so it never
  reaches the browser bundle.

## Step 6 — the checkout page

Add `src/routes/checkout.$reference.tsx` with `<Checkout reference={reference}
prefix="/openreceive" />` from `@openreceive/react`, and import
`@openreceive/react/styles.css` there. After the order is created, navigate
to `/checkout/<id>`. Use the drop-in; do not build your own checkout UI.

## After setup — hand over, then stop

You cannot pay the invoice: the code is receive-only. Do not pay, settle or
mark an order paid, and do not look for a way to.

If the checkout answers 503, the server log names the fix: usually the
migration is not applied, or `openreceive_on_paid` is still the placeholder.

Setup ends here. Your last message starts "Setup is finished" and has at most
five short lines: where to place an order in the preview, the methods the
checkout offers, and that a small real payment from their own wallet marks
the order paid. Send nothing after it. Do not list what changed, offer more
work, or end the message on a question. Name the methods: Bitcoin, plus
USDT, USDC, ETH and SOL when `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` is saved. Do not mention
minimums, and never say a coin will not work or will not be offered.

## Non-negotiables

The recipe below has the code. These are the rules it cannot state for
itself.

- OpenReceive never owns orders, users, prices, or fulfillment.
- Keep `NWC_URI` / `LSC_URI_*` server-only: secrets read with `process.env`
  in `.server.ts` modules. Never a `VITE_` variable, `.env`, browser code or
  a log.
- Do not suggest rotating, revoking or replacing a code because it was pasted
  into this chat; that is the supported path.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` reads and writes every table. Read it only in
  server modules.
- Never grant `anon` or `authenticated` anything on an `openreceive_*` table
  or function, and never add a row level security policy to those tables.
  The server refuses to serve while they can reach them.
- The host owns the price. `amountFor` reads it from the order; reject
  payer-supplied amounts.
- `authorize` runs on every request, and the `resource` it receives is a CLAIM
  the payer made, not proof. Check the `buyer` cookie against the order.
- Receive-only NWC is required; a spend-capable code fails closed unless
  explicitly overridden. Never set that override.
- There is NO merchant-initiated refund of a settled Lightning payment, because
  the wallet cannot spend. Swap refunds — a payer reclaiming a deposit that
  never converted — are the only refund OpenReceive performs. Do not build,
  promise, or imply a Lightning refund path.
- IF YOU TURN SWAPS ON, BUILD THE ROUTE BACK. A deposit that arrives short or
  late is refunded on a SECOND visit, so the order needs its own URL
  (`/checkout/$reference`, with `syncUrl` on `<Checkout>`), and the attempt
  must come back with it: keep the `payment_hash` from `onState` and pass it
  as `resumePaymentHash`. https://openreceive.org/guides/swap-refunds.md
- Show the payer what they are buying: return a `description` beside the
  price from `amountFor`.
- HTTP JSON is snake_case; TypeScript APIs are camelCase.
- Money is integers or decimal strings — never binary floats.

## The quickstart, in full

Inlined verbatim so this file needs no network access. Steps 0–6 above are the setup on Lovable and this recipe is their reference: follow its On Supabase (Lovable) section, not its pg pool, and skip its npm commands. Where the two differ, the steps win.
The page it comes from is https://openreceive.org/guides/tanstack-start-recipe.

## TanStack Start recipe

OpenReceive ships no TanStack Start package. A TanStack Start server route
takes a Web-standard `Request` and returns a `Response`, and so does
`@openreceive/http`, so the integration is the route below. Your server code
creates each Lightning invoice, the payment goes straight to your wallet, and
payment attempts are stored in your app's Postgres database. There is no
OpenReceive account and no background worker.

Optional swaps let customers pay with **USDT, USDC, SOL, and ETH**. A swap
provider you configure converts the payment to **BTC over Lightning**, and it
settles into the same wallet. Available assets and networks depend on the
provider.

This recipe was checked with `@tanstack/react-start` 1.168 and
`@openreceive/*` 0.4.19. The app was built with Lovable's Vite config for
Cloudflare Workers and run under workerd: a buyer's checkout showed a real
Lightning invoice, and a stranger was refused. The Supabase route below runs
in OpenReceive's CI as a Worker, against Supabase's own Postgres image and
API server: a buyer's invoice, a stranger refused, one live attempt under
concurrent requests, and a payment that `openreceive_on_paid` fulfills once.

```sh
npm install @openreceive/http @openreceive/react pg
```

### Where it runs

- **Node** (the `node-server` preset, or any Node host): any Postgres.
- **Cloudflare Workers** (the `cloudflare-module` preset, Lovable's default):
  with Node compatibility, and a Postgres whose certificate a public
  authority signed, such as Neon.
- **Cloudflare Workers with Supabase**, which is every Lovable app: a Worker
  cannot open a Postgres connection to Supabase, whose certificate comes from
  a private authority. Use [On Supabase](#on-supabase-lovable) below, which
  stores payments through Supabase's HTTPS API instead.

Workers ties every socket to the request that opened it, and forbids network
calls at import. So the route builds its database pool and its OpenReceive
stack inside each request, and closes both before it responds. Each request
then opens its own wallet connection; in our test a checkout request took one
to four seconds. The same code works on Node.

### The payment route

Keep the handler in a `.server.ts` module. Route files are also bundled for
the browser, so the route loads the module only when a request arrives:

```ts
// src/routes/openreceive.$.ts — every route under /openreceive/
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

async function openReceive({ request }: { request: Request }): Promise<Response> {
  const { handleOpenReceive } = await import("@/lib/openreceive.server");
  return handleOpenReceive(request);
}

export const Route = createFileRoute("/openreceive/$")({
  server: { handlers: { GET: openReceive, POST: openReceive } },
});
```

```ts
// src/lib/openreceive.server.ts
import { createStack } from "@openreceive/http";
import pg from "pg";
import { findOrder, currentVisitor } from "./orders.server"; // your own orders

export async function handleOpenReceive(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  // Read process.env inside the handler: on Workers it is empty at import.
  const pool = new pg.Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL, max: 1 });
  const stack = createStack({
    wallet: { nwc: process.env.NWC_URI ?? "" },
    storage: {
      db: pool,
      // Runs once, inside the transaction that records the payment.
      onPaid: async ({ reference, paidAt, query }) => {
        await query(
          "UPDATE orders SET state = 'paid', paid_at = $1 WHERE id = $2 AND state = 'awaiting_payment'",
          [paidAt, reference],
        );
      },
    },
    // The price comes from the order row, never from the request.
    amountFor: async (reference) => {
      const order = await findOrder(pool, reference);
      return order?.state === "awaiting_payment"
        ? { currency: order.currency, value: order.amount, description: order.title }
        : null;
    },
    // Only the buyer may pay for their order.
    authorize: async ({ request: incoming, resource }) => {
      const order = resource.reference ? await findOrder(pool, resource.reference) : undefined;
      const visitor = currentVisitor(incoming);
      return Boolean(order && visitor && order.visitor === visitor);
    },
    // Cloudflare sets cf-connecting-ip on every request, and a client cannot.
    // On Node behind your own proxy, read the header that proxy sets.
    rateLimiting: {
      ip: ({ request: incoming }) => incoming.headers.get("cf-connecting-ip") ?? undefined,
    },
  });
  try {
    return await stack.handler(request, { native: request });
  } finally {
    await stack.close();
    await pool.end();
  }
}
```

`authorize` sees the incoming request with its cookies, so check it with
the session your app already has. The Next.js quickstart
explains each hook. They are the same here.

Create OpenReceive's two tables with your migrations, or run
`paymentsSchemaSql("postgres")` from `@openreceive/http` once. It is
idempotent. See Payment storage.

### On Supabase (Lovable)

On Supabase the route keeps payments in your Supabase database through its
HTTPS API, with the project's secret key. There is no `pg` pool. Use
`@openreceive/*` 0.4.23 or newer:

```sh
npm install @openreceive/http @openreceive/react
```

1. Apply the migration from `npx openreceive scaffold payments --supabase`.
   It creates OpenReceive's tables, locked away from the browser's Supabase
   key, and the functions that write them.
2. Replace its placeholder `openreceive_on_paid` with the SQL that marks your
   order paid. It runs inside the transaction that records the payment, for
   the order's first payment only, so a failure there records nothing:

   ```sql
   create or replace function public.openreceive_on_paid(
     p_reference text, p_payment_hash text, p_paid_at bigint
   ) returns void language plpgsql as $$
   begin
     update public.orders set status = 'paid'
      where id = p_reference::uuid and status = 'pending';
   end
   $$;
   ```

3. Write the route's server module:

```ts
// src/lib/openreceive.server.ts
import { createStack } from "@openreceive/http";
import { findOrder, currentBuyer } from "./orders.server"; // your own orders

export async function handleOpenReceive(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  // Read process.env inside the handler: on Workers it is empty at import.
  // Lovable sets SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY for server code.
  const stack = createStack({
    wallet: { nwc: process.env.NWC_URI ?? "" },
    storage: {
      supabase: {
        url: process.env.SUPABASE_URL ?? "",
        key: process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY ?? "",
      },
    },
    // The price comes from the order row, never from the request.
    amountFor: async (reference) => {
      const order = await findOrder(reference);
      return order?.status === "pending"
        ? { currency: order.currency, value: order.total, description: order.title }
        : null;
    },
    // Only the buyer may pay for their order.
    authorize: async ({ request: incoming, resource }) => {
      const order = resource.reference ? await findOrder(resource.reference) : null;
      const buyer = currentBuyer(incoming);
      return Boolean(order && buyer && order.buyer_token === buyer);
    },
    rateLimiting: {
      ip: ({ request: incoming }) => incoming.headers.get("cf-connecting-ip") ?? undefined,
    },
  });
  try {
    return await stack.handler(request, { native: request });
  } finally {
    await stack.close();
  }
}
```

There is no `onPaid`: `openreceive_on_paid` is the fulfillment. `findOrder`
reads the order with your server-side Supabase client; in a Lovable app that
is `supabaseAdmin` from `@/integrations/supabase/client.server`.

The checkout calls the payment routes from the browser with the page's
cookies, and nothing else. A Lovable app keeps its Supabase sign-in in the
browser, not in a cookie, so `authorize` cannot see who is signed in. Give
the buyer a cookie of their own instead: create orders in a server function
that sets an HttpOnly `buyer` cookie (a random value, kept across orders) and
stores the same value on the order as `buyer_token`. `currentBuyer` reads it
back from the request's `cookie` header.

Before it serves, the server checks the database, and the payment routes
answer 503 until the migration is applied and `openreceive_on_paid` is
yours; the log names the fix. More: Supabase over HTTPS.

### The checkout page

```tsx
// src/routes/checkout.$reference.tsx
import { Checkout } from "@openreceive/react";
import "@openreceive/react/styles.css";
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/checkout/$reference")({
  component: OrderCheckout,
});

function OrderCheckout() {
  const { reference } = Route.useParams();
  return <Checkout reference={reference} prefix="/openreceive" />;
}
```

It renders on the server and starts the checkout in the browser. The payer
picks Bitcoin and gets the invoice.

### Settings

- `NWC_URI`: a receive-only code from your wallet
  ([get one](https://openreceive.org/get_a_nwc_code_to_receive_payments)).
  Optional: `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` for swaps
  ([set one up](https://openreceive.org/set_up_swap_provider)).
- `DATABASE_URL`: your Postgres. On serverless hosts use the pooled URL. The
  storage is tested through a transaction pooler.
- On Supabase over HTTPS, instead of `DATABASE_URL`: `SUPABASE_URL` and the
  secret key in `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Lovable sets both itself.

Set them as server secrets, never with a `VITE_` prefix, which would put them
in the browser bundle.

No worker or cron job is needed. Each request to the payment routes also
checks the wallet for settled invoices, through a lock in your database. A
payer who closes the tab is settled on the next request.
