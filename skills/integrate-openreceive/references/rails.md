```

**Step 0 in brief** (Step 0 below has the details):

- Before installing or editing anything, ask the user for a receive-only NWC code. One question per message.
- Next ask for the LSC code. If the user wants stablecoins, USDT, USDC, ETH, SOL or crypto, do not ask yes/no first.
- The user only pastes codes into this chat. Never ask them to edit .env or run a command to save one.
- Write each code into .env yourself, as Step 0 says. Never echo it or put it in a shell command.
- Do not suggest rotating or revoking a code because it was pasted here.
- Start the quickstart only once the NWC code is saved, and the LSC code is saved or the user said "Bitcoin only".

These directions describe OpenReceive 0.4.19.

Add OpenReceive to a Rails application — the app you are already working in. You
do not need a copy of the OpenReceive source: the gem is on RubyGems, the
frontend packages are on npm, and the quickstart is appended to this file in
full, so you can do the whole integration without fetching anything. Prefer the
published gem and the mounted engine routes — do not reimplement wallet RPC,
settlement, or pricing.

Do not clone the OpenReceive repository into this app, and do not copy a demo's
models (`ShopOrder`, `ShopUser`, a signed-cookie visitor) over tables that
already exist. Find this application's order, product, and user models — whatever
they are actually named — and map the three hooks onto those.

Keep this application's view layer, its Devise/session authentication and its
database. Pick the frontend package that matches what already renders here
(`@openreceive/elements` for ERB/Hotwire; `/react`, `/vue`, `/svelte` or
`/angular` for an existing SPA) — do not add React to a Hotwire app. Reuse the
app's existing session or `current_user` in `config.authorize`; the engine's
migration adds only its own two tables to the app's database.

## What OpenReceive is

A payment library that runs inside YOUR server. It mounts HTTP routes in the
application you are editing, issues Lightning invoices against a wallet the
merchant already controls, and calls back into your code when one settles. There
is no OpenReceive account and no API key, and OpenReceive never holds the funds —
the sats land in the wallet the merchant connected.

The one required credential is a receive-only NWC code (Nostr Wallet Connect):
a string from the merchant's wallet that can create invoices and read their
status, and cannot spend. A swap provider (an "LSC" code) optionally lets the
payer send USDT, USDC, ETH or SOL instead, converted into that same
Lightning payment. Step 0 collects those credentials from the user; you write three hooks — `config.authorize`,
`config.amount_for`, `config.on_paid`;
OpenReceive supplies invoices, polling, settlement and the checkout UI. It never
owns orders, users, prices, or fulfillment.

## Step 0 — ask for the two codes, one question at a time

Before anything else, look at one file: the project's `.env`, if it exists.
Read it only far enough to see whether `NWC_URI` and `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` are
there and non-empty, and never print the values. A code that is already
set is not asked for again; if both are set, skip to step 5
(making the server load the file), then the quickstart.

Otherwise your next action is a question to the user. Do not install the gem,
edit the app, write `.env.example`, or search anywhere else before asking
it. Do not read Rails credentials, deploy config (`config/deploy.yml`, `.kamal/secrets`, compose files), Docker containers, or process environments, and never run
`printenv`. A new shop has neither code yet: hunting for one burns the turn and
can leak other secrets into the transcript.

Two server-only URIs are needed before the quickstart:

- `NWC_URI` — a receive-only Nostr Wallet Connect code,
  `nostr+walletconnect://…`. Required for Bitcoin.
- `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` — a Lightning Swap Connect URI,
  `lightning+swapconnect://…`. Required for USDT, USDC, ETH and SOL. Skip it
  only when the user says they want Bitcoin alone.

The user never edits an environment file. They paste each code into the chat;
you store it. Ask one question per message.

1. **First message — the NWC code, and nothing else.** Ask for it and walk them
   through getting it:

   > To receive payments I need a receive-only wallet code. In Rizful: open
   > the menu, tap NWC, choose Receive-only NWC code, and tap Copy
   > (https://openreceive.org/get_a_nwc_code_to_receive_payments). If you would
   > rather run your own wallet, Alby Hub works too: Connections → Add
   > Connection → Read Only. Paste the code here and I will store it.

   Do not mention `.env`, exports, or "tell me when it's set".
2. **When they paste it.** If it does not start with `nostr+walletconnect://`,
   ask them to copy the receive-only code again. Otherwise write
   `NWC_URI=<paste>` into the project's `.env`, creating the file if needed.
   Make sure `.gitignore` covers `.env` (and `.dockerignore`, if the app has
   one). Never echo the value, commit it, or put it in client code. Reply only
   that it is saved, then ask the next question.
3. **Second message — swaps.** If the user already asked for stablecoins or
   altcoins, skip the yes/no and go straight to the walkthrough. Otherwise ask
   whether payers should also be able to pay with USDT, USDC, ETH or SOL. The
   walkthrough:

   > Go to https://lightning-swap.com, sign in for API keys, create a key, and
   > copy the whole URI (https://openreceive.org/set_up_swap_provider). Paste
   > it here and I will store it — or say "Bitcoin only" and I will continue
   > without it.

   Mention FixedFloat only if they already use it.
4. **When they paste it.** If it does not start with
   `lightning+swapconnect://`, ask them to copy it again. Otherwise add
   `LSC_URI_PRIMARY=<paste>` to the same `.env`, without echoing it. Swaps
   are now on, so build the refund route back (the swap non-negotiable below) as
   part of this integration. If they chose Bitcoin only, leave
   `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` unset and skip that route.
5. **Make the server load the file — yourself.** Rails does not read
   `.env` on its own. When the app is started with `bin/rails` or `bin/dev`,
   add `dotenv-rails` to the Gemfile. When it is started with Docker Compose,
   give the service `env_file: .env`. Restart the server after writing the
   file; the values are read at boot.

Do not invent placeholder URIs. Start the quickstart only once `NWC_URI` is
saved and `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` is saved or explicitly declined. The first boot
runs the receive-only preflight: if it reports spend methods such as
`pay_invoice`, remove `NWC_URI` from `.env` and ask for a receive-only code
again. Never set the spend-capable override to get past it.

### Upgrading an existing install

This is not the opening move of a new integration. When OpenReceive is ALREADY
installed here, `bin/rails openreceive:doctor` reports every credential as
set/unset (never the value), the engine mount, the three hooks, and the wallet
preflight. Check the installed `openreceive-rails` and `@openreceive/browser`
against the release named at the top of this file: the headless display models
below do not exist in older versions, and the first tile click throws with
nothing saying why. Upgrade first — and if this app runs in containers, rebuild
the images: the gems are baked into the image, so an in-place `bundle update`
is undone by the next `compose up`.

Only then start the quickstart.

## After the quickstart — hand over, then stop

The quickstart is done when `bin/rails openreceive:doctor` is clean and this
app serves the checkout page for one of its orders. Doctor names any failed
check; fix it before going on.

Give the user that checkout link. The browser check in the quickstart's
"Render the checkout" section (payment-method icons, wallet logos, a pay
tutorial) is theirs: tell them what to look at, and do not run it yourself.

You cannot pay the invoice: the code is receive-only. Do not pay, settle or
mark an order paid, and do not look for a way to (a wallet control port, a
test endpoint, another wallet). If the user wants a real settlement test, they
pay on that link from their own wallet, and `on_paid` marks the order paid.

Setup ends here. Say "Setup is finished" in one message, with the link and
what to check. Do not offer more work or end the message on a question.

## Non-negotiables

The quickstart below has the code. These are the rules it cannot state for
itself, and they hold for every integration.

- OpenReceive never owns orders, users, prices, or fulfillment. The section
  below is how those tables sit next to the engine — not a second order model,
  and not an association to `OpenReceivePayment`.
- Keep `NWC_URI` / `LSC_URI_*` server-only. Never put them in browser code,
  logs, or assets.
- Do not suggest rotating, revoking or replacing a code because it was pasted
  into this chat; that is the supported path.
- Work only in this application. Never read or run anything from another
  project on this machine (its `node_modules`, tools or source), for any
  reason. A browser and Playwright are not part of setup.
- The host owns the price. `config.amount_for` reads it from your own data;
  reject payer-supplied amounts.
- `config.authorize` runs on every request, and the `resource` it receives is a
  CLAIM the payer made, not proof. Read the framework session; never trust a
  body field. The generator installs `OpenReceive::ALLOW_ALL_AUTHORIZE`, a
  placeholder that allows everything (the engine warns at boot while it is
  set) — replace it with this app's real ownership check, same as `on_paid`.
- `config.on_paid` must be idempotent. Its database fulfillment commits once per `reference` — your order
  id, one per thing you fulfill, created before checkout, kept across retries,
  never reused. A fresh id per page load lets one order be paid twice.
- Receive-only NWC is required; a spend-capable code fails closed at boot unless
  explicitly overridden.
- There is NO merchant-initiated refund of a settled Lightning payment, because
  the wallet cannot spend. Swap refunds — a payer reclaiming a deposit that
  never converted — are the only refund OpenReceive performs, and only from the
  `refund_required` provider state. Do not build, promise, or imply a Lightning
  refund path.
- IF YOU TURN SWAPS ON, BUILD THE ROUTE BACK. A deposit that arrives short or
  late becomes `refund_required`, and the payer claims it on a SECOND VISIT,
  after leaving your page to fetch an address from another wallet. Three things
  must exist or that money is unreachable through your UI: a per-order URL your
  server serves (`/checkout/:reference` — `syncUrl` on `<Checkout>`, `sync-url`
  or `resumable` on `<openreceive-checkout>`), your own order-summary route to
  restore the order from, and the ATTEMPT.
  `/checkouts/prepare` returns no attempts, so a checkout rebuilt from the
  reference alone opens on the method grid. Re-picking the same coin
  (`POST /swaps`) re-serves the committed attempt — but only while it is live,
  and the shadow invoice behind a swap lasts about half an hour, after which the
  same click mints a NEW deposit address and the refund is off-screen. Keep the
  `payment_hash` and reopen the attempt with `POST /swaps/status`, which has no
  such window. On the drop-ins: `resumePaymentHash`, fed from `onState`, on
  `<Checkout>`; the `resume-payment-hash` attribute, fed from the
  `openreceive-state` event (`event.detail.state.payment_hash`), on
  `<openreceive-checkout>`. https://openreceive.org/guides/swap-refunds.md
- Show the payer WHAT THEY ARE BUYING. Return an optional `description` beside
  the price from `config.amount_for` and both drop-ins render it above the
  amount. Without it the checkout is a QR and "$1.00" with no sign of what the
  dollar is for.
- Show the payer the transaction record: `createTransactionDetails(...)` rows,
  collapsed behind a caret, on the live checkout AND on the receipt. A payment
  hash and a deposit txid are the only evidence a payer has that they paid you.
  `<openreceive-checkout>` / React's `<Checkout>` already render this panel and
  the `description` — these two rules cost you code only on a custom UI or your
  own receipt page, never a reason to replace the drop-in. (It returns no rows
  while the rail is `checkout_lock` — before the payer has chosen anything
  there is no transaction — so render the caret only when the rows are
  non-empty.)
- HTTP JSON is snake_case; the browser packages' TypeScript APIs are camelCase.
- Money is integers or decimal strings — never binary floats.

## Your tables, not ours

The install migration adds `openreceive_payments` and `openreceive_meta` to THIS
application's database. That is the whole persistence OpenReceive needs. It does
not replace your orders, users, or products, and you do not join them.

- **Find this app's models first.** They may be named `Order`, `Invoice`,
  `Booking`, `Product`, `Variant`, `User`, `Account` — anything. Wire the hooks
  to those. Do not generate a parallel `ShopOrder` / `ShopProduct` / `ShopUser`
  stack.
- **The payable row's id is the `reference`.** Create it before checkout, keep
  it across retries, never reuse it. Pass that id to `<openreceive-checkout>`. A
  fresh id per page load lets one order be paid twice.
- **Products (or the catalog) are the price authority.** Order creation reads
  live prices into the order (snapshot line items if this app has them).
  `config.amount_for` reads only that order — never a payer-supplied amount,
  never a live catalog lookup that could re-price a cart already placed. Return
  `{ currency:, value: }` as a decimal STRING, plus a `description` of what they
  are buying.
- **Users own the order; OpenReceive never sees them.** `config.authorize` uses
  the same ownership check this app already uses on the order show / pay page —
  `session[:user_id]`, Devise's `current_user`, a signed cookie, whatever it is.
  `context[:resource][:reference]` is a claim the payer sent, not proof.
- **The order is unpaid or paid.** Do not copy `pending` / `expired` / `failed`
  / `attention` onto it. Those are attempt statuses on `openreceive_payments`. An
  expired invoice does not cancel the order; a later checkout may mint another
  attempt. The engine refuses a new checkout under a reference that already
  settled (409).
- **Do not associate `OpenReceivePayment`.** No `has_many`, no `belongs_to`, no
  foreign key either direction. `reference` is not unique (many attempts per
  order). Fulfillment is a guarded transition on YOUR order row inside
  `config.on_paid` — `UPDATE … WHERE state = awaiting_payment` (or this app's
  equivalent). Database writes only in the hook; emails, jobs, and broadcasts
  after commit.

## If you build your own checkout UI

The engine serves JSON only, so the view is yours — but the drop-ins
(`<openreceive-checkout>`, React's `<Checkout>`) already obey all of this. This
list is the short form of https://openreceive.org/guides/checkout-ux.md, for a UI
built on `@openreceive/browser/headless`. Read that before writing components.

- Check Bitcoin → Switch payment method → Bitcoin: the grid must hide the
  Lightning invoice, then restore the same bolt11 without another mint.
- `createCheckoutController` is the engine. Do not hand-roll a poll loop.
- `createCheckoutStatusModel` for the status line. Do not draw a
  Cart → Pay → Done stepper. Read the model's `phase`, not the snapshot's.
- `resolveWizardSelection` decides whether to ask "which network?". A
  one-network asset starts the swap from the tile. Key `selectedAssetByGroup`
  by group (`USDT`), valued by `pay_in_asset` (`USDT_TRON`).
- `createMethodGridDisplay` for tiles, including `limitMessage` so an
  unavailable method says the minimum in the payer's currency.
- `createSwapDisplayModel` → `display.copyRows` for deposits: address, memo,
  and the bare amount each get a copy row. Render `swap.networkWarning*` as
  the model gives it.
- `swap.deposit_amount` is the only amount a payer is told to send. Never put
  a fiat valuation of it (`swap.fee.pay_in_fiat`) next to a stablecoin amount:
  "$50.03" under "50.05 USDC" reads as a typo, and the payer asks which one to
  send. The one fiat figure on a USDT/USDC deposit panel is the cart total
  (`payout_fiat`); express "you send" and the fee in the token. Use
  `createSwapFeeBreakdown(fee, swap)` — with the swap, not the fee alone — and
  it applies this for you; SOL and ETH keep a fiat breakdown.
- `createCheckoutSession` owns mint and swap start. To start swaps, pass its
  `swap` option (`selection`, `prefix`, `fetch`) together. Without it
  `startSwap` reports through `onError`.
- `createQrSvg` is async. Use `createQrSvgController` so you do not render
  `[object Promise]`.
- `checkoutLabels` for every payer-facing string. Only write copy it lacks.
- `stageSwapRefund` then `confirmSwapRefund` — only the second submits.
  Validate with `getSwapRefundFormError`. Treat `409` as a normal outcome.
- Pass `{ resumable: true }` to `createSwapDisplayModel` when the payer has
  a URL they can come back to, and render `display.refundReturnLabel`.
  Resume helpers (`createGuestCheckoutResume`, `createGuestOrderFetcher`)
  are on `@openreceive/browser`, not `/headless`.
- A refund replaces the deposit panel. On `refund_required` also drop
  "switch payment method".
- No "Open wallet" button on desktop.
- Wallet suggestions: `getPaymentWizardRoutes()` +
  `createWizardRouteDisplays`. Lightning only. Logos are data URIs; tutorial
  images load from a JavaScript chunk. For a custom headless UI, load it when
  a tutorial opens and look up the returned table by the tutorial's `path`:

  ```js
  import { loadPayTutorialImages } from "@openreceive/browser/headless";

  const images = await loadPayTutorialImages();
  const src = images[tutorial.path]; // data URI for the selected tutorial
  ```

  Render `src` as the image source and update your UI after loading. Existing
  display objects do not update: their `tutorial.image` stays `undefined` if
  created before loading. Alternatively, await the loader, recreate the displays
  with `createWizardRouteDisplays`, and render the new `tutorial.image`.
  Show the caption while loading or if loading fails; never use an empty image
  source. Deploy all JavaScript chunks and allow `data:` in CSP `img-src`.
  For missing images, check CSP errors, failed chunks, and stale displays.
  Registry paths are lookup keys; there is no asset option or image route.
  The registry answers ~37 wallets: pass
  `providerPreviewLimit` and build "show all" from `display.providerCount`,
  or they push the QR off the screen.

## The quickstart, in full

Inlined verbatim so this file needs no network access — follow it once Step 0
passes. The page it comes from is https://openreceive.org/guides/quickstart-rails.

## Rails quickstart

Requires Ruby ≥ 3.2 and Rails ≥ 8.0.

Add the Rails engine gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "openreceive-rails"
```

That is the whole install. `openreceive-rails` depends on `openreceive`,
`openreceive-server` and `nwc-ruby`, so the default wallet client works with
nothing else added. It is built from `NWC_URI`. If your app brings its own NWC
client, set `config.nwc_client` instead.

There is one native prerequisite. `nwc-ruby` uses `rbsecp256k1`, which builds
libsecp256k1 from source. Minimal images (`ruby:3.3-slim`, fresh Docker builds)
need the autotools for that, or `bundle install` fails with
`autoreconf: not found`. Install them before bundling:

```sh
apt-get install -y autoconf automake libtool build-essential pkg-config
```

Full Ruby images and typical developer machines already have these.

Then run:

```sh
bin/rails generate openreceive:install
bin/rails db:migrate
```

The migration adapts to your app's database adapter. PostgreSQL, SQLite, and
MySQL (`mysql2`/`trilogy`) are supported.
→ [openreceive:install](https://openreceive.org/guides/api-reference.md#openreceiveinstall)

The `openreceive:install` generator emits three things:

- `db/migrate/*_create_openreceive_tables.rb`: one migration that creates both
  engine tables (`openreceive_payments` and `openreceive_meta`).
- A simplified `config/initializers/openreceive.rb`.
- The `OpenReceive::Engine` route mount at `/openreceive`.

The engine owns the `OpenReceivePayment` model, so no model file is generated.
The engine also owns the table's commit locking, write-once settlement, and
reconciliation state machine. `reference` is indexed but not unique, because
one reference may have many historical attempts. `payment_hash` is globally
unique.

#### Fulfill exactly once

Within OpenReceive's own settlement paths, `on_paid` runs at most once per
reference. If a second invoice for the same reference is paid, OpenReceive
records that payment with `status_reason = "duplicate_settlement"` and does
not fulfill again.

One case is yours to handle. **If anything other than OpenReceive can also
fulfill an order**, such as an admin action, a second payment processor, or a
replayed job, those paths race each other. Then `on_paid` must be idempotent.
The generated initializer explains this and shows the guarded transition:

```ruby
config.on_paid = lambda do |settlement|
  claimed = Order
              .where(id: settlement.reference, state: "awaiting_payment")
              .update_all(state: "paid", paid_at: Time.at(settlement.paid_at).utc)
  next if claimed.zero? # someone else already fulfilled it

  # FulfillOrder — like Order — is your own application code: ship the goods,
  # enqueue the confirmation email. OpenReceive provides neither.
  FulfillOrder.call(Order.find(settlement.reference), payment_hash: settlement.payment_hash)
end
```

Delivery is at-least-once. `on_paid` runs inside the settlement transaction. If
it raises, the transaction rolls back and the next pass retries. So keep
`on_paid` to database writes on the order. An email or webhook sent from here
would survive the rollback and go out again. The `state: "paid"` transition
above is the flag. Let your own job drain it after commit.

**`update_all` fires no Active Record callbacks.** That is intended. It runs one
conditional `UPDATE`, so the claim is atomic and no model code runs between the
check and the write. It also means there is no `after_commit` to attach a
post-commit side effect to. That is fine for a background job that drains the
flag. It does not help a page that needs to know right away. If you push
settlement over Action Cable, or your model owns the transition through
callbacks, take a row lock for the duration instead:

```ruby
config.on_paid = lambda do |settlement|
  order = Order.lock.find_by(id: settlement.reference)   # SELECT … FOR UPDATE
  next unless order && order.state == "awaiting_payment"
  order.update!(state: "paid", paid_at: Time.at(settlement.paid_at).utc)  # callbacks fire
end
```

**Unlocking a download works the same way.** If the payer bought a file, do not
unlock it in the browser. Gate the download route on the paid order row, and
serve the file only if that row exists:
`Order.find_by(id: params[:id], user: current_user, state: "paid")`, or a 404
otherwise. The `state: "paid"` written above is the unlock. The client never
decides that an order was fulfilled. It re-reads the row. Buy a Button's
`ShopController#download` does this in twenty lines.

Both shapes are idempotent and correct. They differ only in whether your model
layer runs:

- `update_all` skips the model layer. It is the right default.
- The row lock holds the row for the duration of the block. Use it when the
  transition has to go through your model.

The generated fulfillment note says the same thing. If your fulfillment is a
read-modify-write that one conditional `UPDATE` cannot express, take the lock.

Either way, the rule above still holds: the callback must only make database
writes on the order. `after_commit` on the settlement transaction runs after
OpenReceive's own commit. So an email enqueued there is as safe as one enqueued
from a job that drains the flag. An email sent *inline* from `on_paid` is not
safe, in either shape.

Buy a Button
(`examples/buttons/server/rails`)
is a runnable illustration of this boundary. It is not a template to copy
models from. It has products, visitors, and orders, and the three hooks are the
only bridge. Map that shape onto the models in THIS app.

Supply the receive-only wallet connection as `ENV["NWC_URI"]`. Never put it in
browser code, logs, or assets. Your application refuses to start when the code
advertises spend methods such as `pay_invoice`. To override that explicitly,
set `config.allow_spend_capable_wallet = true` or
`OPENRECEIVE_ALLOW_SPEND_CAPABLE_NWC=true` ([Security](https://openreceive.org/guides/security.md)).

OpenReceive reads `ENV`. Rails does not load a `.env` file on its own, so
something has to put the values there first: `dotenv-rails`, an exported shell
environment, or your production secret manager.
→ [Environment variables](https://openreceive.org/guides/environment-variables.md).

### Configure the host hooks

The initializer needs three things: authorization, the trusted price, and
fulfillment. All three receive the `reference`. This is a string you choose,
and it is the fulfillment identity. Use your order id:

- one per thing you fulfill,
- created before checkout,
- kept across retries,
- never reused.

OpenReceive never looks inside it. But `on_paid` commits fulfillment once per
reference, and a new checkout under a reference that already settled is
refused with 409. A fresh id per page load would let one order be paid twice.

```ruby
OpenReceive.configure do |config|
  # `Order` throughout is YOUR model — it could be named anything. OpenReceive
  # never sees it or touches its table; these hooks are the only bridge
  # between the engine and your data.
  #
  # Your policy, called before every checkout/payment/swap request. `context`
  # is a Hash with three symbol keys:
  #   context[:action]   — which route: "checkout.prepare", "checkout.create",
  #                        "payment.check", "swap.quote", "swap.create",
  #                        "swap.read", or "swap.refund"
  #   context[:request]  — the ActionDispatch::Request; read your session,
  #                        cookies, or headers from it, as in a controller
  #   context[:resource] — { reference:, payment_hash: } copied from the

`OpenReceive.configure` sets the three host hooks. `on_paid` runs inside the
settlement transaction, only for the first settled attempt for a reference.
→ [OpenReceive.configure](https://openreceive.org/guides/api-reference.md#openreceiveconfigure)

The engine's controllers inherit from `config.parent_controller`. The generated
initializer sets it to `"ApplicationController"`. That is how the engine picks
up your application's `protect_from_forgery`. Keep `csrf_meta_tags` in the
layout that renders the checkout. The checkout client sends `X-CSRF-Token` from
it automatically.

The same inheritance also brings every global `before_action` that your
`ApplicationController` declares. A filter that redirects signed-out users to a
login page will redirect the engine's JSON routes too. A guest checkout then
never gets an invoice. The engine reads nothing from the parent except forgery
protection. `config.authorize` receives the request, and your policy reads its
own session from it. So if your `ApplicationController` has such filters, do one
of these:

- Point `config.parent_controller` at a slimmer controller that still calls
  `protect_from_forgery`.
- Skip the filter for the engine only:

```ruby
# config/initializers/openreceive.rb (after OpenReceive.configure)
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  OpenReceive::ApplicationController.skip_before_action :require_login
end
```

Keep the filters your authorize policy depends on, such as a tenant resolver
or `Current` attributes. They run before `config.authorize`.

The generated initializer ships two placeholders. Replace both, not just
`on_paid`:

- `config.on_paid = OpenReceive::LOGGING_ON_PAID` only logs the settlement and
  fulfills nothing. Replace it with your real fulfillment (as above). Until you
  do, orders would be recorded as settled without ever being fulfilled, so the
  engine warns every time your application boots.
- `config.authorize = OpenReceive::ALLOW_ALL_AUTHORIZE` allows everything. It
  treats possession of the reference as authorization, which is safe only while
  references are unguessable. The engine warns at boot until you replace it
  with your own ownership check (as above).

The amount always comes from your own order record. Payer-supplied amounts are
rejected. The advanced hooks `resolve_checkout` and `on_checkout_created` remain
as overrides for apps with a custom repository. They are not part of the
quickstart.

For public web shops, turn on the per-IP invoice cap with
`config.rate_limiting = true`. Leave it off (the default) when many payers
share one IP. → [Rate limiting](https://openreceive.org/guides/rate-limiting.md#rails)

In production, the engine builds the wallet client when your app boots. It
also runs the receive-only preflight right away: it reaches the wallet and
checks that the code cannot spend. A missing `NWC_URI`, a dead relay, or a
spend-capable wallet then stops the deploy. Otherwise those problems would
show up as 500 errors for customers on the first checkout. Outside production
(tests, consoles), the engine builds the client lazily, on first use, so no
live wallet is needed.

### Render the checkout

Serve the compiled `styles.css` without Tailwind processing. Either import it
from JavaScript (with a CSS-capable bundler) or use a plain
`<link rel="stylesheet">`. Do not `@import` it into your Tailwind entry. Its
rules have zero specificity, so your own styles can override checkout styles.
Scoping does not prevent that.

The engine serves JSON checkout routes only. Your view does the rendering. Any
OpenReceive frontend package works against the `/openreceive` mount. The
smallest is the custom element. Its default `prefix` is already
`/openreceive`. The package ships a self-contained `styles.css` that a plain
stylesheet link can serve, scoped to what OpenReceive renders.

```erb
<%# app/views/orders/pay.html.erb %>
<openreceive-checkout reference="<%= @order.id %>"></openreceive-checkout>
```

```js
// In your JS bundle (esbuild/webpacker with CSS support):
import { defineElements } from "@openreceive/elements";
import "@openreceive/elements/styles.css"; // or link the compiled styles.css

// Registers the <openreceive-checkout> tag with the browser. Without this,
// the tag in the ERB above is unknown markup and renders as nothing; with it,
// the element wakes up wherever the tag appears. Call once per page — order
// relative to the markup does not matter.
defineElements();
```

If you bundle with esbuild (jsbundling-rails), build ESM and load it as a
module. esbuild's default IIFE output runs a dependency's Node fallback in the
browser, which throws `ReferenceError: __filename is not defined`:

```sh
esbuild app/javascript/application.js --bundle --format=esm --outdir=app/assets/builds
```

```erb
<%= javascript_include_tag "application", type: "module" %>
```

Everything the checkout draws ships inside the JavaScript: the payment-method
icons, the wallet logos and the pay tutorials. There is no image file to copy
or serve and no asset option to set. Deploy your normal JavaScript and CSS
build output, including any generated JavaScript chunks. Bundlers with code
splitting can load tutorial screenshots only when a tutorial is first opened.
Single-file builds, including the standalone checkout, include them upfront. If
your Content-Security-Policy has a strict `img-src`, allow `data:`
([Provider registry](https://openreceive.org/guides/provider-registry.md#assets)).

Then open the checkout in a browser. Confirm the payment-method icons and
wallet logos render, and open a wallet's pay tutorial to check its screenshots.
If an image is missing, check the console for CSP violations and the Network
panel for failed JavaScript chunks. Allow `data:` in `img-src` and deploy the
complete build output. Do not add image routes, copy package source images, or
use registry `icon_path` / tutorial `path` keys as browser URLs.

The element creates the checkout for `reference`, then renders and polls
itself. React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular apps use the matching wrapper package
instead, with the same props and defaults
([Frontend checkout](https://openreceive.org/guides/frontend-checkout.md)). Build a custom checkout only if
this app cannot use a drop-in. In that case `@openreceive/browser/headless` is
the API ([Headless checkout](https://openreceive.org/guides/headless-checkout.md)).

### Reconciliation

Settlement runs on the request path. You do not need a cron job. Disable or
tune it with `config.opportunistic_reconcile` (`false`, or
`{ min_interval_seconds: … }`).

Optionally, run one worker so settlement does not wait for the next page
load:

```sh
bin/rails openreceive:notifications
```

→ [rake openreceive:notifications](https://openreceive.org/guides/api-reference.md#rake-openreceivenotifications)

To run a pass yourself, use the one-shot `OpenReceive.reconcile!` or
`bin/rails openreceive:reconcile`.
→ [OpenReceive.reconcile!](https://openreceive.org/guides/api-reference.md#openreceivereconcile)

### Swap secrets

The Ruby server recognizes `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` and `LSC_URI_BACKUP`, using the
shared [Lightning Swap Connect](https://openreceive.org/guides/lightning-swap-connect.md) vectors. Setting
either one auto-builds the matching provider. So an app that wants swaps only
supplies the connection strings
([Environment variables](https://openreceive.org/guides/environment-variables.md)). To override this, use
`config.swap_providers`. Pass your own adapters to replace the auto-built set,
or an empty array to disable swaps.

One `openreceive_payments` row holds at most one provider order, in its
server-only `swap_data`. The engine hides `swap_data` from Active Record
inspection and ordinary serialization. Do not serialize it explicitly, log it,
or return it from your own API. It may contain a provider credential.

**Setting either connection string commits you to refunds.** A swap deposit can
arrive short or late. The provider then marks it `refund_required`, and only
your UI can claim it. The payer claims it on a second visit, after leaving your
page to get an address in another wallet. That needs three things:

- a per-order URL your app serves,
- a route that restores the order behind it,
- something that restores the ATTEMPT, since `/checkouts/prepare` returns none.

[Swap refunds](https://openreceive.org/guides/swap-refunds.md) covers all of it. Read it before you set
`LSC_URI_PRIMARY`.
