# OpenReceive agent directions (Laravel)

These directions describe OpenReceive 0.4.15.

Add OpenReceive to a Laravel application — the app you are already working in.
You do not need a copy of the OpenReceive source: the package is on Packagist
(`openreceive/laravel`), the frontend packages are on npm, and the quickstart is
appended to this file in full, so you can do the whole integration without
fetching anything. Prefer the published package and the routes its service
provider mounts — do not reimplement wallet RPC, settlement, or pricing.

Do not clone the OpenReceive repository into this app, and do not copy a demo's
models (`ShopOrder`, `ShopUser`, an encrypted-cookie visitor) over tables that
already exist. Find this application's order, product, and user models — whatever
they are actually named — and map the three hooks onto those.

Keep this application's view layer, its authentication (Breeze, Fortify,
Jetstream, Sanctum, a plain session guard — whatever `Auth` already uses), its
Eloquent models and its database. Pick the frontend package that matches what
already renders here (`@openreceive/elements` for Blade/Livewire/Inertia-less
pages; `/react`, `/vue`, `/svelte` or `/angular` for an existing SPA or Inertia
app) — do not add React to a Blade app. Reuse the app's existing
`$request->user()` or session in `Host::authorize`; the engine's migration adds
only its own two tables to the app's database, through `php artisan migrate`.

## What OpenReceive is

A payment library that runs inside YOUR server. It mounts HTTP routes in the
application you are editing, issues Lightning invoices against a wallet the
merchant already controls, and calls back into your code when one settles. There
is no OpenReceive account and no API key, and OpenReceive never holds the funds —
the sats land in the wallet the merchant connected.

The one required credential is a receive-only NWC code (Nostr Wallet Connect):
a string from the merchant's wallet that can create invoices and read their
status, and cannot spend. A swap provider (an "LSC" code) optionally lets the
payer send USDT, USDC, ETH or SOL instead, converted into that same
Lightning payment. Step 0 collects those credentials from the user; you write three hooks — `authorize`,
`amountFor`, `onPaid` on one `App\OpenReceive\Host` class;
OpenReceive supplies invoices, polling, settlement and the checkout UI. It never
owns orders, users, prices, or fulfillment.

## Step 0 — ask for the two codes, one question at a time

Before anything else, look at one file: the project's `.env`, if it exists.
Read it only far enough to see whether `NWC_URI` and `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` are
there and non-empty, and never print the values. A code that is already
set is not asked for again; if both are set, skip to step 5
(making the server load the file), then the quickstart.

Otherwise your next action is a question to the user. Do not install the package,
edit the app, write `.env.example`, or search anywhere else before asking
it. Do not read deploy config (compose files, Forge/Vapor/Envoyer panels), Docker containers, or process environments, and never run
`printenv`. A new shop has neither code yet: hunting for one burns the turn and
can leak other secrets into the transcript.

Two server-only URIs are needed before the quickstart:

- `NWC_URI` — a receive-only Nostr Wallet Connect code,
  `nostr+walletconnect://…`. Required for Bitcoin.
- `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` — a Lightning Swap Connect URI,
  `lightning+swapconnect://…`. Required for USDT, USDC, ETH and SOL. Skip it
  only when the user says they want Bitcoin alone.

The user never edits an environment file. They paste each code into the chat;
you store it. Ask one question per message.

1. **First message — the NWC code, and nothing else.** Ask for it and walk them
   through getting it:

   > To receive payments I need a receive-only wallet code. In Rizful: open
   > the menu, tap NWC, choose Receive-only NWC code, and tap Copy
   > (https://openreceive.org/get_a_nwc_code_to_receive_payments). If you would
   > rather run your own wallet, Alby Hub works too: Connections → Add
   > Connection → Read Only. Paste the code here and I will store it.

   Do not mention `.env`, exports, or "tell me when it's set".
2. **When they paste it.** If it does not start with `nostr+walletconnect://`,
   ask them to copy the receive-only code again. Otherwise write
   `NWC_URI=<paste>` into the project's `.env`, creating the file if needed.
   Make sure `.gitignore` covers `.env` (and `.dockerignore`, if the app has
   one). Never echo the value, commit it, or put it in client code. Reply only
   that it is saved, then ask the next question.
3. **Second message — swaps.** If the user already asked for stablecoins or
   altcoins, skip the yes/no and go straight to the walkthrough. Otherwise ask
   whether payers should also be able to pay with USDT, USDC, ETH or SOL. The
   walkthrough:

   > Go to https://lightning-swap.com, sign in for API keys, create a key, and
   > copy the whole URI (https://openreceive.org/set_up_swap_provider). Paste
   > it here and I will store it — or say "Bitcoin only" and I will continue
   > without it.

   Mention FixedFloat only if they already use it.
4. **When they paste it.** If it does not start with
   `lightning+swapconnect://`, ask them to copy it again. Otherwise add
   `LSC_URI_PRIMARY=<paste>` to the same `.env`, without echoing it. Swaps
   are now on, so build the refund route back (the swap non-negotiable below) as
   part of this integration. If they chose Bitcoin only, leave
   `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` unset and skip that route.
5. **Make the server load the file — yourself.** Laravel loads
   `.env` itself. If the app runs `php artisan config:cache`, run
   `php artisan config:clear` (or re-cache) after writing the file: a cached
   config never reads `.env` again. When the app is started with Docker
   Compose, give the service `env_file: .env`. Restart the server after
   writing the file.

Do not invent placeholder URIs. Start the quickstart only once `NWC_URI` is
saved and `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` is saved or explicitly declined. The first boot
runs the receive-only preflight: if it reports spend methods such as
`pay_invoice`, remove `NWC_URI` from `.env` and ask for a receive-only code
again. Never set the spend-capable override to get past it.

### Upgrading an existing install

This is not the opening move of a new integration. When OpenReceive is ALREADY
installed here, `php artisan openreceive:doctor` reports every credential as
set/unset (never the value), the host class and any placeholder hooks, the
route mount, and the wallet preflight. Check the installed
`openreceive/laravel` (`composer show openreceive/laravel`) and
`@openreceive/browser` against the release named at the top of this file: the
headless display models below do not exist in older versions, and the first
tile click throws with nothing saying why. Upgrade first — and if this app runs
in containers, rebuild the images: `vendor/` is baked into the image, so an
in-place `composer update` is undone by the next `compose up`.

Only then start the quickstart.

## Non-negotiables

The quickstart below has the code. These are the rules it cannot state for
itself, and they hold for every integration.

- OpenReceive never owns orders, users, prices, or fulfillment. The section
  below is how those tables sit next to the engine — not a second order model,
  and not an Eloquent model over `openreceive_payments`.
- Keep `NWC_URI` / `LSC_URI_*` server-only. Never put them in browser code,
  logs, or assets.
- The host owns the price. `amountFor` reads it from your own data; reject
  payer-supplied amounts.
- `authorize` runs on every request, and the `resource` it receives is a CLAIM
  the payer made, not proof. Read the Illuminate request it is handed — the
  session, `$request->user()`; never trust a body field. `openreceive:install`
  scaffolds `use AllowAllAuthorize;`, a placeholder trait that allows
  everything (the engine warns at boot while it is there) — replace it with
  this app's real ownership check, same as `onPaid`.
- `onPaid` must be idempotent. Its database fulfillment commits once per `reference` — your order
  id, one per thing you fulfill, created before checkout, kept across retries,
  never reused. A fresh id per page load lets one order be paid twice.
- Receive-only NWC is required; a spend-capable code fails closed at boot unless
  explicitly overridden.
- There is NO merchant-initiated refund of a settled Lightning payment, because
  the wallet cannot spend. Swap refunds — a payer reclaiming a deposit that
  never converted — are the only refund OpenReceive performs, and only from the
  `refund_required` provider state. Do not build, promise, or imply a Lightning
  refund path.
- IF YOU TURN SWAPS ON, BUILD THE ROUTE BACK. A deposit that arrives short or
  late becomes `refund_required`, and the payer claims it on a SECOND VISIT,
  after leaving your page to fetch an address from another wallet. Three things
  must exist or that money is unreachable through your UI: a per-order URL your
  server serves (`/checkout/:reference` — `syncUrl` on `<Checkout>`, `sync-url`
  or `resumable` on `<openreceive-checkout>`), your own order-summary route to
  restore the order from, and the ATTEMPT.
  `/checkouts/prepare` returns no attempts, so a checkout rebuilt from the
  reference alone opens on the method grid. Re-picking the same coin
  (`POST /swaps`) re-serves the committed attempt — but only while it is live,
  and the shadow invoice behind a swap lasts about half an hour, after which the
  same click mints a NEW deposit address and the refund is off-screen. Keep the
  `payment_hash` and reopen the attempt with `POST /swaps/status`, which has no
  such window. On the drop-ins: `resumePaymentHash`, fed from `onState`, on
  `<Checkout>`; the `resume-payment-hash` attribute, fed from the
  `openreceive-state` event (`event.detail.state.payment_hash`), on
  `<openreceive-checkout>`. https://openreceive.org/guides/swap-refunds.md
- Show the payer WHAT THEY ARE BUYING. Return an optional `description` beside
  the price from `amountFor` and both drop-ins render it above the
  amount. Without it the checkout is a QR and "$1.00" with no sign of what the
  dollar is for.
- Show the payer the transaction record: `createTransactionDetails(...)` rows,
  collapsed behind a caret, on the live checkout AND on the receipt. A payment
  hash and a deposit txid are the only evidence a payer has that they paid you.
  `<openreceive-checkout>` / React's `<Checkout>` already render this panel and
  the `description` — these two rules cost you code only on a custom UI or your
  own receipt page, never a reason to replace the drop-in. (It returns no rows
  while the rail is `checkout_lock` — before the payer has chosen anything
  there is no transaction — so render the caret only when the rows are
  non-empty.)
- HTTP JSON is snake_case; the browser packages' TypeScript APIs are camelCase.
- Money is integers or decimal strings — never binary floats.

## Your tables, not ours

The install migration adds `openreceive_payments` and `openreceive_meta` to THIS
application's database. That is the whole persistence OpenReceive needs. It does
not replace your orders, users, or products, and you do not join them.

- **Find this app's models first.** They may be named `Order`, `Invoice`,
  `Booking`, `Product`, `Variant`, `User`, `Account` — anything. Wire the hooks
  to those. Do not generate a parallel `ShopOrder` / `ShopProduct` / `ShopUser`
  stack.
- **The payable row's id is the `reference`.** Create it before checkout, keep
  it across retries, never reuse it. Pass that id to `<openreceive-checkout>`. A
  fresh id per page load lets one order be paid twice.
- **Products (or the catalog) are the price authority.** Order creation reads
  live prices into the order (snapshot line items if this app has them).
  `amountFor` reads only that order — never a payer-supplied amount, never a
  live catalog lookup that could re-price a cart already placed. Return
  `['currency' => …, 'value' => …]` with `value` a decimal STRING, plus a
  `description` of what they are buying.
- **Users own the order; OpenReceive never sees them.** `authorize` uses the
  same ownership check this app already uses on the order show / pay page —
  `$request->user()`, a policy, a session key, an encrypted cookie, whatever
  it is. `$context->reference()` is a claim the payer sent, not proof.
- **The order is unpaid or paid.** Do not copy `pending` / `expired` / `failed`
  / `attention` onto it. Those are attempt statuses on `openreceive_payments`. An
  expired invoice does not cancel the order; a later checkout may mint another
  attempt. The engine refuses a new checkout under a reference that already
  settled (409).
- **Do not model `openreceive_payments`.** No Eloquent model, no `hasMany`, no
  `belongsTo`, no foreign key either direction. `reference` is not unique (many
  attempts per order). Fulfillment is a guarded transition on YOUR order row
  inside `onPaid` — `Order::where(...)->where('state', 'awaiting_payment')->update(...)`
  (or this app's equivalent), with no `DB::transaction()` of your own around it.
  Database writes only in the hook; emails, jobs, and broadcasts after commit
  (implement `OpenReceive\Hosts\AfterPaid` for those).

## If you build your own checkout UI

The engine serves JSON only, so the view is yours — but the drop-ins
(`<openreceive-checkout>`, React's `<Checkout>`) already obey all of this. This
list is the short form of https://openreceive.org/guides/checkout-ux.md, for a UI
built on `@openreceive/browser/headless`. Read that before writing components.

- Check Bitcoin → Switch payment method → Bitcoin: the grid must hide the
  Lightning invoice, then restore the same bolt11 without another mint.
- `createCheckoutController` is the engine. Do not hand-roll a poll loop.
- `createCheckoutStatusModel` for the status line. Do not draw a
  Cart → Pay → Done stepper. Read the model's `phase`, not the snapshot's.
- `resolveWizardSelection` decides whether to ask "which network?". A
  one-network asset starts the swap from the tile. Key `selectedAssetByGroup`
  by group (`USDT`), valued by `pay_in_asset` (`USDT_TRON`).
- `createMethodGridDisplay` for tiles, including `limitMessage` so an
  unavailable method says the minimum in the payer's currency.
- `createSwapDisplayModel` → `display.copyRows` for deposits: address, memo,
  and the bare amount each get a copy row. Render `swap.networkWarning*` as
  the model gives it.
- `swap.deposit_amount` is the only amount a payer is told to send. Never put
  a fiat valuation of it (`swap.fee.pay_in_fiat`) next to a stablecoin amount:
  "$50.03" under "50.05 USDC" reads as a typo, and the payer asks which one to
  send. The one fiat figure on a USDT/USDC deposit panel is the cart total
  (`payout_fiat`); express "you send" and the fee in the token. Use
  `createSwapFeeBreakdown(fee, swap)` — with the swap, not the fee alone — and
  it applies this for you; SOL and ETH keep a fiat breakdown.
- `createCheckoutSession` owns mint and swap start. To start swaps, pass its
  `swap` option (`selection`, `prefix`, `fetch`) together. Without it
  `startSwap` reports through `onError`.
- `createQrSvg` is async. Use `createQrSvgController` so you do not render
  `[object Promise]`.
- `checkoutLabels` for every payer-facing string. Only write copy it lacks.
- `stageSwapRefund` then `confirmSwapRefund` — only the second submits.
  Validate with `getSwapRefundFormError`. Treat `409` as a normal outcome.
- Pass `{ resumable: true }` to `createSwapDisplayModel` when the payer has
  a URL they can come back to, and render `display.refundReturnLabel`.
  Resume helpers (`createGuestCheckoutResume`, `createGuestOrderFetcher`)
  are on `@openreceive/browser`, not `/headless`.
- A refund replaces the deposit panel. On `refund_required` also drop
  "switch payment method".
- No "Open wallet" button on desktop.
- Wallet suggestions: `getPaymentWizardRoutes()` +
  `createWizardRouteDisplays`. Lightning only. Logos are data URIs; tutorial
  images load from a JavaScript chunk. For a custom headless UI, load it when
  a tutorial opens and look up the returned table by the tutorial's `path`:

  ```js
  import { loadPayTutorialImages } from "@openreceive/browser/headless";

  const images = await loadPayTutorialImages();
  const src = images[tutorial.path]; // data URI for the selected tutorial
  ```

  Render `src` as the image source and update your UI after loading. Existing
  display objects do not update: their `tutorial.image` stays `undefined` if
  created before loading. Alternatively, await the loader, recreate the displays
  with `createWizardRouteDisplays`, and render the new `tutorial.image`.
  Show the caption while loading or if loading fails; never use an empty image
  source. Deploy all JavaScript chunks and allow `data:` in CSP `img-src`.
  For missing images, check CSP errors, failed chunks, and stale displays.
  Registry paths are lookup keys; there is no asset option or image route.
  The registry answers ~37 wallets: pass
  `providerPreviewLimit` and build "show all" from `display.providerCount`,
  or they push the QR off the screen.

## The quickstart, in full

Inlined verbatim so this file needs no network access — follow it once Step 0
passes. The page it comes from is https://openreceive.org/guides/quickstart-laravel.

## Laravel quickstart

Requires PHP ≥ 8.2 (64-bit) and Laravel ≥ 11 (12 current). You also need these
PHP extensions:

- `ext-gmp`, which is REQUIRED. The NWC transport's elliptic-curve math depends
  on it.
- `sodium` and `mbstring`.
- The `pdo_*` driver for your database (`pdo_pgsql`, `pdo_mysql` or
  `pdo_sqlite`).

`php -m` lists what your build has. To add gmp on Debian/Ubuntu, run
`apt-get install php8.2-gmp`. In the official Docker image, run
`docker-php-ext-install gmp`.

Add the Laravel package:

```sh
composer require openreceive/laravel
```

That is the whole install. `openreceive/laravel` depends on
`openreceive/openreceive`, the engine. So the default wallet client works with
nothing else added. It is built from `NWC_URI`. Package discovery registers the
service provider. If your app brings its own NWC client, bind
`OpenReceive\Nwc\ReceiveNwcClient` in the container instead.

Then run:

```sh
php artisan openreceive:install
php artisan migrate
```

`openreceive:install` writes three files:

- `config/openreceive.php`: the settings. The host hook is a CLASS NAME, not a
  closure. `php artisan config:cache` serializes this file, and a closure
  anywhere in it makes the cache fail.
- `app/OpenReceive/Host.php`: the three hooks (`authorize`, `amountFor`,
  `onPaid`), with the two generated placeholders wired in and the fulfillment
  note as comments.
- `database/migrations/*_create_openreceive_tables.php`: one migration for both
  engine tables (`openreceive_payments` and `openreceive_meta`). Its DDL comes
  from the engine's `PaymentsSchema::statements()` for your connection's
  driver: PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB or SQLite. `php artisan migrate` runs it
  like any of your own migrations. There is no second runner.

→ [OpenReceive\Storage](https://openreceive.org/guides/api-reference.md#openreceivestorage)

There is no Eloquent model for the engine's tables, and you do not write one.
The engine owns the table's commit locking, write-once settlement, and
reconciliation state machine. `reference` is indexed but not unique, because
one reference may have many historical attempts. `payment_hash` is globally
unique.

#### Fulfill exactly once

Within OpenReceive's own settlement paths, `onPaid` runs at most once per
reference. A second payment to a second invoice is recorded with
`status_reason = "duplicate_settlement"` and never fulfills again.

One case is yours to handle. **If anything other than OpenReceive can also
fulfill an order**, such as an admin action, a second payment processor, or a
replayed job, those paths race each other. Then `onPaid` must be idempotent.
The generated `Host.php` explains this and shows the guarded transition:

```php
public function onPaid(PaymentSettlement $settlement): void
{
    $claimed = Order::where('id', $settlement->reference)
        ->where('state', 'awaiting_payment')
        ->update(['state' => 'paid', 'paid_at' => Carbon::createFromTimestampUTC($settlement->paidAt)]);
    if ($claimed === 0) {
        return; // someone else already fulfilled it
    }
    // The 'paid' state IS the flag. Ship the goods and send the mail from a job
    // that drains it after commit, or from afterPaid() below — never from here.
}
```

Delivery is at-least-once. `onPaid` runs inside the settlement transaction. If
it throws, the transaction rolls back and the next pass retries. So keep
`onPaid` to database writes on the order. An email or webhook sent from here
would survive the rollback and go out again. The `'paid'` transition above is
the flag. Drain it after commit in one of two ways:

- Let your own job drain it.
- Implement `OpenReceive\Hosts\AfterPaid`. Its
  `afterPaid(PaymentSettlement $settlement)` runs after COMMIT, best-effort,
  for the same first settled attempt. Put `FulfillOrder::dispatch(…)` or an
  event there.

Do not open a `DB::transaction()` of your own inside `onPaid`. The engine
already holds the transaction on this connection, and PDO refuses a nested
`BEGIN`.

**A query-builder `update()` fires no model events.** That is intended. It
runs one conditional `UPDATE`, so the claim is atomic and no model code runs
between the check and the write. It also means no observer, no `saved` event
and no `Model::updated` listener runs. That is fine for a job that drains the
flag. It does not work for a model that owns the transition through events. If
yours does, take a row lock for the duration instead:

```php
public function onPaid(PaymentSettlement $settlement): void
{
    $order = Order::lockForUpdate()->find($settlement->reference);   // SELECT … FOR UPDATE
    if ($order === null || $order->state !== 'awaiting_payment') {
        return;
    }
    $order->update(['state' => 'paid', 'paid_at' => Carbon::createFromTimestampUTC($settlement->paidAt)]);  // events fire
}
```

**Unlocking a download works the same way.** If the payer bought a file, do not
unlock it in the browser. Gate the download route on the paid order row, and
serve the file only if that row exists:
`Order::where('id', $id)->where('user_id', $request->user()->id)->where('state', 'paid')->firstOrFail()`,
or a 404 otherwise. The `'paid'` written above is the unlock. The client never
decides that an order was fulfilled. It re-reads the row. Buy a Button's
`ShopController::download` does this in twenty lines.

Both shapes are idempotent and correct. They differ only in whether your model
layer runs:

- The query-builder `update()` skips the model layer. It is the right default.
- The row lock holds the row for the duration of the method. Use it when the
  transition has to go through your model.

The generated fulfillment note says the same thing. If your fulfillment is a
read-modify-write that one conditional `UPDATE` cannot express, take the lock.

Buy a Button
(`examples/buttons/server/laravel`)
is a runnable illustration of this boundary. It is not a template to copy
models from. It has products, visitors, and orders, and the three hooks are the
only bridge. Map that shape onto the models in THIS app.

### Add wallet credentials

Laravel loads `.env` itself, and `config/openreceive.php` reads the values
through `env()`:

```dotenv
NWC_URI=
LSC_URI_PRIMARY=
LSC_URI_BACKUP=
```

1. Get a receive-only NWC code from a compatible wallet
   ([get one here](https://openreceive.org/get_a_nwc_code_to_receive_payments)).
   Put it in `NWC_URI`.
2. Optional: set up a [swap provider](https://openreceive.org/set_up_swap_provider).
   Put its connection string in `LSC_URI_PRIMARY`, and a second one in
   `LSC_URI_BACKUP` if you have one.

Never put these values in browser code. Your app refuses to start if the NWC
code also advertises spend methods such as `pay_invoice`. Create a
receive-only code instead ([Security](https://openreceive.org/guides/security.md)).

Under `php artisan config:cache`, Laravel never reads `.env` at runtime. The
values are captured when you cache, as with every other Laravel secret. So
re-run `config:cache` after changing one. The engine redacts connection
strings in every log line. `php artisan openreceive:doctor` prints each
variable only as set or unset.
→ [Environment variables](https://openreceive.org/guides/environment-variables.md).

### Configure the host hooks

`app/OpenReceive/Host.php` needs three things: authorization, the trusted
price, and fulfillment. All three receive the `reference`. This is a string you
choose, and it is the fulfillment identity. Use your order id:

- one per thing you fulfill,
- created before checkout,
- kept across retries,
- never reused.

OpenReceive never looks inside it. But `onPaid` commits fulfillment once per
reference, and a new checkout under a reference that already settled is
refused with 409. A fresh id per page load would let one order be paid twice.

```php
<?php

namespace App\OpenReceive;

use App\Models\Order;                      // YOUR model — it could be named anything.
use Carbon\Carbon;
use OpenReceive\Host as OpenReceiveHost;
use OpenReceive\PaymentSettlement;
use OpenReceive\Server\AuthorizeContext;

final class Host implements OpenReceiveHost
{
    // Your policy, called before every checkout/payment/swap request.
    //   $context->action    — "checkout.prepare", "checkout.create", "payment.check",
    //                         "swap.quote", "swap.create", "swap.read" or "swap.refund"
    //   $context->request   — the Illuminate\Http\Request: read the session, the
    //                         authenticated user, cookies or headers, as in a controller
    //   $context->resource  — ['reference' => …, 'payment_hash' => ?] copied from the
    //                         payer's JSON body. It names an order; it does not prove
    //                         this caller owns it. reference is always a validated
    //                         non-empty string (≤200 chars); payment_hash is null except
    //                         on payment.check / swap.read / swap.refund.

`config/openreceive.php` names that class
(`'host' => App\OpenReceive\Host::class`). The provider resolves it from the
container, so it may take constructor dependencies. `onPaid` runs inside the
settlement transaction, only for the first settled attempt for a reference.
→ [OpenReceive\Host](https://openreceive.org/guides/api-reference.md#openreceivehost) ·
[the authorize context](https://openreceive.org/guides/api-reference.md#the-authorize-context-php)

The routes mount under `config('openreceive.route_prefix')` (`openreceive`),
with the middleware in `config('openreceive.middleware')` (`['web']`). The
`web` group is how the engine picks up your application's session and CSRF
protection. Laravel's `VerifyCsrfToken` reads `X-CSRF-TOKEN`. The checkout
client sends it automatically from
`<meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">`, so keep that tag in
the layout that renders the checkout.

The `web` group also brings every middleware it carries. A global `auth`
redirect on the `web` group would send the engine's JSON routes to a login page
too. Keep such guards on your own route groups, not on `web` itself.

The generated `Host.php` ships two placeholders. Replace both, not just
`onPaid`:

- `use LoggingOnPaid;` only logs the settlement and fulfills nothing. Replace
  it with your real fulfillment (as above). Until you do, orders would be
  recorded as settled without ever being fulfilled, so the engine warns every
  time your application boots.
- `use AllowAllAuthorize;` allows everything. It treats possession of the
  reference as authorization, which is safe only while references are
  unguessable. The engine warns at boot until you replace it with your own
  ownership check (as above).

The amount always comes from your own order record. Payer-supplied amounts are
rejected. The engine's `PaymentRepository` interface remains the escape hatch
for apps with custom storage. It is not part of the quickstart.

For public web shops, turn on the per-IP invoice cap with
`'rate_limiting' => true`. Leave it off (the default) when many payers share
one IP. The client IP is `$request->ip()`, so behind a proxy Laravel's
`TrustProxies` decides who the payer is. → [Rate limiting](https://openreceive.org/guides/rate-limiting.md)

In production, the engine builds the wallet client when your app boots. It
also runs the receive-only preflight right away: it reaches the wallet and
checks that the code cannot spend. A missing `NWC_URI`, a dead relay, or a
spend-capable wallet then stops the deploy. Otherwise those problems would
show up as 500 errors for customers on the first checkout. Outside production
(tests, consoles), the engine builds the client lazily, on first use, so no
live wallet is needed.

PHP builds the whole engine again on every request. Under PHP-FPM or Apache,
that same preflight would then run per request. To avoid that, the package
caches the wallet's info event in your default cache store for
`config('openreceive.wallet_info_cache_seconds')` (600). A checkout request
then costs one relay round trip, not two.

### Render the checkout

Serve the compiled `styles.css` without Tailwind processing. Either import it
from JavaScript (with a CSS-capable bundler) or use a plain
`<link rel="stylesheet">`. Do not `@import` it into your Tailwind entry. Its
rules have zero specificity, so your own styles can override checkout styles.
Scoping does not prevent that.

The engine serves JSON checkout routes only. Your view does the rendering. Any
OpenReceive frontend package works against the `/openreceive` mount. The
smallest is the custom element. Its default `prefix` is already
`/openreceive`. The package ships a self-contained `styles.css`, scoped to what
OpenReceive renders. Laravel ships Vite, so the package installs like any other
frontend dependency:

```sh
npm install @openreceive/elements
```

```js
// resources/js/app.js — in the entry @vite() already loads
import { defineElements } from "@openreceive/elements";
import "@openreceive/elements/styles.css";

// Registers the <openreceive-checkout> tag with the browser. Without this,
// the tag in the Blade below is unknown markup and renders as nothing; with
// it, the element wakes up wherever the tag appears. Call once per page —
// order relative to the markup does not matter.
defineElements();
```

```blade
{{-- resources/views/orders/pay.blade.php --}}
<openreceive-checkout reference="{{ $order->id }}"></openreceive-checkout>
```

The element creates the checkout for `reference`, then renders and polls
itself. React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular apps use the matching wrapper package
instead, with the same props and defaults
([Frontend checkout](https://openreceive.org/guides/frontend-checkout.md)). Build a custom checkout only if
this app cannot use a drop-in. In that case `@openreceive/browser/headless` is
the API ([Headless checkout](https://openreceive.org/guides/headless-checkout.md)).

Everything the checkout draws ships inside the JavaScript: the payment-method
icons, the wallet logos and the pay tutorials. There is no image file to copy
or serve and no asset option to set. Deploy your normal JavaScript and CSS
build output, including any generated JavaScript chunks. Bundlers with code
splitting can load tutorial screenshots only when a tutorial is first opened.
Single-file builds, including the standalone checkout, include them upfront. If
your Content-Security-Policy has a strict `img-src`, allow `data:`
([Provider registry](https://openreceive.org/guides/provider-registry.md#assets)).

Then open the checkout in a browser. Confirm the payment-method icons and
wallet logos render, and open a wallet's pay tutorial to check its screenshots.
If an image is missing, check the console for CSP violations and the Network
panel for failed JavaScript chunks. Allow `data:` in `img-src` and deploy the
complete build output. Do not add image routes, copy package source images, or
use registry `icon_path` / tutorial `path` keys as browser URLs.

**No npm in this project?** Every GitHub release attaches
`standalone-checkout-<version>.tar.gz`. It holds one self-registering ESM file,
its stylesheet and a `MANIFEST.json` of hashes. Unpack it into
`public/openreceive/`, and the same element needs just two tags:

```blade
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/openreceive/openreceive-checkout.css" />
<script type="module" src="/openreceive/openreceive-checkout.js"></script>

<openreceive-checkout reference="{{ $order->id }}"></openreceive-checkout>
```

`MANIFEST.json` carries the version and a SHA-256 per file. Keep the tarball
version in step with the Composer package.

### Reconciliation

Settlement runs on the request path. You do not need a cron job. Disable or
tune it with `'opportunistic_reconcile'` (`false`, or
`['min_interval_seconds' => …]`).

Optionally, run one worker so settlement does not wait for the next page
load:

```sh
php artisan openreceive:notifications
```

The worker listens for the wallet's NWC-02 `payment_received` notifications.
The same process also runs a periodic reconcile pass. Run one per deployment,
not one per web instance.

Two more commands help:

- `php artisan openreceive:reconcile` runs one pass, if you want to drive it
  yourself.
- `php artisan openreceive:doctor` reports every credential as set or unset,
  the host and its placeholders, the route mount, and the wallet preflight.

### Swap secrets

The package recognizes `LSC_URI_PRIMARY` and `LSC_URI_BACKUP`, using the
shared [Lightning Swap Connect](https://openreceive.org/guides/lightning-swap-connect.md) vectors. Setting
either one auto-builds the matching provider. So an app that wants swaps only
supplies the connection strings
([Environment variables](https://openreceive.org/guides/environment-variables.md)). To override this, use the
`openreceive.swap_providers` container binding. Bind a list of your own
adapters to replace the auto-built set, or `[]` to disable swaps.

One `openreceive_payments` row holds at most one provider order, in its
server-only `swap_data`. The engine never returns `swap_data` from its routes
or writes it to a log. Do not select it into your own API, serialize it, or
log it. It may contain a provider credential.

**Setting either connection string commits you to refunds.** A swap deposit can
arrive short or late. The provider then marks it `refund_required`, and only
your UI can claim it. The payer claims it on a second visit, after leaving your
page to get an address in another wallet. That needs three things:

- a per-order URL your app serves,
- a route that restores the order behind it,
- something that restores the ATTEMPT, since `/checkouts/prepare` returns none.

[Swap refunds](https://openreceive.org/guides/swap-refunds.md) covers all of it. Read it before you set
`LSC_URI_PRIMARY`.
